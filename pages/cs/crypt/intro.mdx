# Cryptography

Cryptography is the study of using algorithms to protect digital
information against adversarial attacks.

classical cryptography - designing and using codes that enable two parties
to send messages while keeping those messages hidden from an eavesdropper
who can monitor all communication between them

key - a secret shared by the parties in advance

plaintext - the raw, unencrypted form of the message to be sent

ciphertext - the message encrypted

encrypt - "scrambling" the message encryption scheme - the method of
scrambling the message decrypt - unscramble the message to get the
plaintext

symetric algorithm

- encryption scheme where parties a and b use a single secret key to
  encrypt and decrypt
