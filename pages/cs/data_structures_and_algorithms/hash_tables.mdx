# Hash Tables

A **hash table** is a data structure where keys are organized into smaller
groups that can be quickly searched. Hash tables are a remarkably useful
data structure. They implement the abstract data type _dictionary_, a
variation of the _symbol table_ ADT.

A closely related ADT is the _map_. Many authors use the terms _map_ and
_dictionary_ synonymously, but these notes distinguish the two. When a
symbol table is implemented with a search tree, we call the resulting ADT a
**map**. When implemented with a hash table, the resulting ADT is a
**dictionary**. We maintain these distinctions to keep communication clear.
That said, it's critical to keep in mind that there is no established
terminology on the matter. Languages themselves give different names to
ADTs implemented with hash tables:

1. Python calls them _dictionaries_.
2. JavaScript calls them _object literals_.
3. C++, Java, Go, and Scala call them _maps_.
4. Ruby, ever the odd, calls them _hashes_.

To summarize, here are the relevant definitions:

> **definition: symbol table.** An abstract data type consisting of
> unordered key-value pairs, where the key is some instance of a primitive
> data type, and the value is some instance of data.

> **definition: dictionary.** A symbol table implemented with a hash table.

> **definition: map.** A symbol table implemented with a search tree.

For this section, we'll examine the hash table implementation.

## Demand for Hash Tables

Hash tables exist because of the conflicting tradeoffs in searching on
arrays. With arrays, we get constant time access and all the benefits of
caching, but at the cost of ${O(1)}$ linear search. If we sort the
elements, we can better our situation up to ${O(\lg n)}$ with binary
search, but then we introduce the bottleneck and complexity of sorting.
Hash tables are an attempt at hitting the middle ground — fast searching
and fast access. The cost: We don't get anywhere near the benefits of
caching from using arrays and we require far more memory.

## Basic Idea

To understand hashing, we'll toy with some ludicrous ideas. Say we had the
following array:

```
A [8] [3] [6] [10] [15] [18] [4]
   0   1   2   3    4    5    6
```

Suppose we're asked to build a data structure that allows the user to
determine if an element ${n}$ exists in the array, in ${O(1)}$ time. That
takes binary search and linear search off the table. So what can we do?
Well, we could store the elements in an array where the indices correspond
to the actual elements. We'll call this new data structure `H`:

```
        [3][4]   [6]   [8]   [10]                [15]        [18]
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18
```

This does, in fact, give us ${O(1)}$ search. If the user wants to know
whether `𝑁` is comprised, they just have to write `H[𝑁]`. If a number is
returned, `𝑁` is comprised. Otherwise, they'll get some specified value,
perhaps `null`.

Of course, this isn't very feasible. Suppose the array was simply:

```
[100000000000]
```

Sparing the trouble, that's one hundred billion. We'd need a `H` of size
one hundred billion just to store that one element. This isn't some
outlandish concern. String encodings today go up to the million! Clearly,
our initial data structure `H` is only ideal for the smallest cases. But,
the idea is there and it isn't bad, so let's build on it.

## Hash Functions

Thinking carefully about the problem with `H`, we realize that the problem
stems from the way we _map_ the elements to the indices. With our initial
approach, it was a 1-to-1 mapping:

$$
	k \rarr \mm{array[k]}
$$

More specifically, we passed ${k}$ to some function, and that function
returned a value that we used to index into the array:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	&k \rarr \mm{array[$h(k)$]} \\[1em]
	&\tt{where} h(x) = x
\end{aligned}
$$

The function ${h(x)}$ is a type of **hash function**, and when it takes the
form ${h(x) = x,}$ we call it **ideal hashing**.

Let's try a different function:

$$
	h(x) = x \rod 10
$$

This is the remainder (or modulo) operation from number theory (divide
${x}$ by ${10,}$ give me the remainder). Say we had the following array:

```
A [8] [3] [6] [10] [15] [4]
   0   1   2   3    4    6
```

we get the following (where ${k}$ is an element in the array):

| ${k}$ | ${h(k) = k \rod 10}$ |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| 8     | 8                    |
| 3     | 3                    |
| 6     | 6                    |
| 10    | 0                    |
| 15    | 5                    |
| 4     | 4                    |

The resulting array uses substantially less space;

```
ideal hashing:

         [3][4]   [6]   [8]   [10]                [15]
 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15



new hash function:

[10]     [3][4][15][6]  [8]
 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
```

It seems we've solved the problem. At least until the the value ${18}$ is
added to the array:

| ${k}$ | ${h(k) = k \rod 10}$ |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| 8     | ${{8}}$              |
| 3     | 3                    |
| 6     | 6                    |
| 10    | 0                    |
| 15    | 5                    |
| 4     | 4                    |
| 18    | ${{8}}$              |

An array slot can only hold one element at a time, and we've gotten
ourselves in tangle — the values ${8}$ and ${18}$ map to the same index.
This is called a **collision**. Now we have to solve this problem. We have
some options:

1. **closed hashing** — We keep the size of our table fixed. To prevent
   collisions, we'll either (1) modify our hash function, (2) use some
   contigency procedure in the event of a collision, or (3) some
   combination of both.
2. **open hashing** — Forget all of the complexity with writing hash
   functions and dealing with minutiae — just use more memory.

## Open Hashing

Also called **chaining**, open hashing is a straightforward approach to
handling collisions. Instead of having the hash table's underlying array
store the values directly, we have it store an array of pointers to linked
lists.

For example, say we had the array:

```
[16 12 25 39 6 122 5 68 75]
```

To store these values, we use our usual hash function:

| ${k}$ | ${h(k) = k \rod 10}$ |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| 16    | 6                    |
| 12    | 2                    |
| 25    | 5                    |
| 39    | 9                    |
| 6     | 6                    |
| 122   | 2                    |
| 5     | 5                    |
| 68    | 8                    |
| 75    | 5                    |

This results in the hash table:

```rust
0 [ • ]
1 [ • ]
2 [ •-]-->{12}-->{122}
3 [ • ]
4 [ • ]
5 [ •-]-->{25}-->{5}-->{75}
6 [ •-]-->{16}-->{6}
7 [ • ]
8 [ •-]-->{68}
9 [ •-]-->{39}
```

This successfully (and easily) solves the collision problem. But there's a
catch. Say we had ${n = 100}$ keys. The size of our hash table is
${S = 10.}$ Using these assumed values, the hash table world provides a
special value:

$$
	\lambda = \dfrac{n}{S} = \dfrac{100}{10} = 10
$$

This is called the **load factor** — the number of keys divided by the size
of the table. To see why this value is important, let's say the ${100}$
keys are uniformly distributed. I.e., each of our hash table's spaces gets
${10}$ keys.

Because our hash function is a simple modulo operation, it takes ${O(1)}$
time to obtain the hash table's index. And because the keys are uniformly
distributed, the average time it takes to reach a successful search for a
key is:

$$
	T = 1 + \dfrac{\lambda}{2}
$$

One for obtaining the hash table index, and ${\lambda / 2}$ for the
average. That's the average time for a successful search. For the average
of an unsuccessful search, we get:

$$
	T = 1 + \lambda
$$

That is, we get all the way to the end of the hash table. Now we see why
that load factor is critical. If we had ${10~000}$ keys and only ${10}$
spaces, we'd have:

$$
	\lambda = \dfrac{10~000}{10} = 1000
$$

That's far too large of a load factor. For chaining, an ideal load factor
is less than ${2.}$ Thus, we might consider making our hash table bigger:

$$
	\lambda = \dfrac{10~000}{5~000} = 2
$$

Of course, this means we must consume more memory. But, we did say forget
about all of those shenanigans with hash functions.

Unfortunately, even if we were content with consuming more memory, we still
likely spoke too soon — there's another problem with chaining that lies in
ambush. Suppose we start with an empty hash table, and we did allocate a
size of ${5000}$. Then we get a key space that looks like:

$$
	\set{35, 95, 145, 155, 205, 305, \ldots, 5n}
$$

The resulting hash table:

<div className={`hashtbl`}>

| 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5          | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | ${\ldots}$ | ${5n}$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---------- | ------ |
|     |     |     |     |     | 35         |     |     |     |     |            |        |
|     |     |     |     |     | 95         |     |     |     |     |            |        |
|     |     |     |     |     | 145        |     |     |     |     |            |        |
|     |     |     |     |     | 155        |     |     |     |     |            |        |
|     |     |     |     |     | 205        |     |     |     |     |            |        |
|     |     |     |     |     | 305        |     |     |     |     |            |        |
|     |     |     |     |     | ${\vdots}$ |     |     |     |     |            |        |
|     |     |     |     |     | ${5n}$     |     |     |     |     |            |        |

</div>
 

With our current hash function, as long as the user enters some multiple of
${5,}$ the entries will be appended to the list mapped to index ${5.}$ This
is called **clustering**, and is arguably an even worse problem than what
we grappled with earlier. Why? Because now the hash table is no longer
_uniformly distributed_. Which means that none of our load factor analysis
was correct to begin with.

## Linear Probing

An alternative technique to resolving collisions is _linear probing_. To
illustrate, we'll use the same simple hash function:

$$
	h(x) = x \bmod 10	
$$

Let's suppose our keyspace is:

$$
	\set{26, 30, 45, 23, 25, 43, 74}
$$

Just as we did in the previous sections, let's map the keys using the hash
function (we'll stop when we encounter a collission):

<div className={`hashtbl`}>

| 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 30  |     |     | 23  |     | 45  | 26  |     |     |     |

</div>

Once we hit 25, we encounter a collision. We need it at 5, but 5 is already
occupied by 45. What we can do is check if the next space is available:

<div className={`hashtbl`}>

| 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5          | 6          | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
| 30  |     |     | 23  |     | 45         | 26         |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     | ${\times}$ | ${\times}$ |     |     |     |

</div>

The next index is occupied, so move try the next:

<div className={`hashtbl`}>

| 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5          | 6          | 7              | 8   | 9   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | -------------- | --- | --- |
| 30  |     |     | 23  |     | 45         | 26         |                |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     | ${\times}$ | ${\times}$ | ${\checkmark}$ |     |     |

</div>

We have a space, so we place 25 at this index:

<div className={`hashtbl`}>

| 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 30  |     |     | 23  |     | 45  | 26  | 25  |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

</div>
