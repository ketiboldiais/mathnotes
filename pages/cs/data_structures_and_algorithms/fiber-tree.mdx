> __~definition: fiber tree~.__ A _fiber tree_ is a directed tree with the following properties.
> 
> 1. There exists a single node with an in-degree of 0, called the _root_.
> 2. All vertices other than the root have an out-degree of at least 1, and an in-degree of at least 1.
> 3. If a vertex ${v}$ is a parent, then there exists a directed edge between ${v}$ and its child.
> 4. If a vertex ${c}$ is a child, then there exists a directed edge between ${c}$ and its parent.
> 5. If a vertex ${s}$ is a sibling, then there exists a directed edge between ${s}$ and all its siblings.

~case~. The Document Object Model (DOM) can be interpreted as a fiber tree.

~case~. React's virtual DOM is implemented as a fiber tree.
