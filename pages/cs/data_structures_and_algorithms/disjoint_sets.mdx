# Disjoint Sets

Suppose we had the following graphs:

<Graph
	data={[
		[1, 2],
		[2, 3],
		[3, 4],
		[5, 6],
		[6, 7],
		[7, 8],
	]}
	scale={60}
	height={300}
/>

We can represent these graphs as sets:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		S_1 &= \{ 1,2,3,4 \} \\
		S_2 &= \{ 5,6,7,8 \}
	\end{aligned}
$$

The intersection of these two sets is null:

$$
	S_1 \cap S_2 = \varnothing
$$

Therefore, we say that ${S_1}$ and ${S_2}$ are **disjoint**.

## Find Operation

On the disjoint set data structure, the `find()` operation returns the set
an input argument ${n}$ belongs to. For example, `find(5)` returns ${S_2,}$
and `find(3)` returns ${S_1.}$ If no such element exists, `find()` (as
defined in these materials) returns `null`.

## Union Operation

The `union()` operation connects two vertices on the graph. For example,
`union(4,8)` results in:

<Graph
	data={[
		[1, 2],
		[2, 3],
		[3, 4],
		[5, 6],
		[6, 7],
		[7, 8],
		[4, 8],
	]}
	scale={60}
	height={300}
/>

Importantly, the `union()` operation, at least one the disjoint set data
structure, will only connect two vertices ${v_1}$ and ${v_2}$ if, and only
if, ${v_1}$ and ${v_2}$ are members of different sets. That is, there isn't
already a path connecting the two of them. For example, `union(1,2)` will
not do anything, because `1` and `2` are members of the same set â€” ${S_1.}$

Now, notice what happens if we call `union(1,5)`:

<Graph
	data={[
		[1, 2],
		[2, 3],
		[3, 4],
		[4, 8],
		[5, 6],
		[1, 5],
		[6, 7],
		[7, 8],
	]}
	blast={50}
	scale={60}
	height={300}
/>

Now all of the vertices are connected in a single graph. Additionally, the
earlier individual sets are no more. We now just have one set:

$$
	S = \{ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 \}
$$

This yields a valuable piece of information: The graph contains a _cycle_.
