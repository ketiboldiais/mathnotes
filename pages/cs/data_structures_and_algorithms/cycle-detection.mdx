# Cycle Detection


Recall that a _cycle_ is a walk where the only repeated vertices are the first and the last. Below, graphs ${A}$ and ${C}$ contain cycles, but graphs ${B}$ and ${D}$ do not. _Cycle detection algorithms_ are algorithms whose core objective is determining whether a given graph ${G}$ contains a cycle. The algorithm has many applications, most commonly in cryptography. For example, cycle lengths are one benchmark for assessing a pseudorandom number generator's strength (in short, how close to random the generator's outputs are).

A common algorithm for detecting cycles is the _White-grey-black (WGB) Algorithm_.

### White-grey-black Algorithm

<table className={`trace`}><tbody>
<tr><td width={'50%'}>

The WGB algorithm is a type of coloring algorithm. We have a palette of size 3: ${\set{\tx{white}, \tx{grey}, \tx{black}}.}$ The color white corresponds to _unvisited_, grey to _visiting_, and black to _visited_. To illustrate, we'll use shown, which contains the cycle ${f-h-i-j.}$ Below is the adjacency list representation of the graph.

$$
	\small G \gets \lset{\ax{
		a &\mapsto& \ix{c} \\
		b &\mapsto& \ix{a} \\
		c &\mapsto& \ix{~~} \\
		f &\mapsto& \ix{h} \\
		g &\mapsto& \ix{f,j} \\
		h &\mapsto& \ix{i} \\
		i &\mapsto& \ix{j} \\
		j &\mapsto& \ix{f}
	}}

As we'll see, it doesn't matter which node we start at. Suppose we start on ${a.}$ When we land on ${a,}$ we see that it's white, which tells us that it's unvisited. So, we change its color to grey.

Now we travel to ${a}$'s neighbors. Here, there is only one: ${c.}$ We go to ${c,}$ and see that it's white. It hasn't been visited. So, we color ${c}$ grey.

Now we travel to ${c}$'s neighbors. ${c}$ has no neighbors, so we conclude that ${c}$ has now been visited. Color it black and get back to ${a.}$ Notice that in the adjacency list, we've replaced the vertices with black-squares. This emphasizes the fact that whenever we encounter these black squares, we immediately conclude that these vertices have been visited, and we do not visit them.

The ${b}$ node has a single neighbor ${a,}$ but we've already visited ${a.}$ 
So, we get back to ${b,}$ and color it black, since ${a}$ was ${b}$'s only neighbor. The next vertex in the list is ${c,}$ but ${c}$ is already visited. So, we go to the next vertex, ${f,}$ and mark it as visiting.

${j}$ has one neighbor, ${f,}$ so we had there. Upon arriving at ${f,}$ however, we see that ${f}$ is colored grey. This means that we're already currently visiting ${f.}$ Which in turn means we have a _cycle_.


$$
	\small G \gets \lset{\ax{
		\bs &\mapsto& \ix{\bs} \\
		\bs &\mapsto& \ix{\bs} \\
		\bs &\mapsto& \ix{~~} \\
		\wd{f} &\mapsto& \ix{\wd{h}} \\

		h &\mapsto& \ix{\wd{i}} \\
		i &\mapsto& \wd{j} \\
		j &\mapsto& \ix{f}
	}}
$$

Accordingly, we can immediately return true — ${G}$ contains a cycle. Thus, the basic idea is: If we _can_ run a depth-first traversal without encountering a grey neighbor, then ${G}$ _does not_ contain a cycle. Inversely, if we _cannot_ run a depth-first traversal without encountering a grey neighbor, then ${G}$ _does_ contain a cycle.

### Application: Circular Dependency
Sophisticated modern computer programs rely on potentially thousands of modules, often written by firms and engineers outside the program's manufacturer. This introduces the problem of _circular dependency_ — a relation where two or more modules rely on one another, directly or indirectly. These modules are called _mutually recursive modules_, and they almost always generate substantial problems. Consider, for example, the dependency graph below, where a circular dependency is marked with red edges, alongside an accompanying edge list.

<Grid cols={2}>
$$
	\mx{
		\ix{d,b} \\
		\ix{b,a} \\
		\ix{a,c} \\
		\ix{c,e} \\

		\ix{d,e} \\
		\ix{o,p}

</Grid>

As we can likely tell, determining whether a dependency graph contains a cycle is nothing more than a cycle detection problem, and we can use the WGB algorithm. The only difference, is, we'll convert the edge list representation to an adjacency list. A more interesting result for this particular application is its complexity analysis. Here, the time complexity is of order ${\bigO{v + n},}$ and the space complexity is of order ${\bigO{v + n},}$ where ${v}$ is the number of modules, and ${n}$ is the number of dependencies. Or, in graph theory terms, ${v}$ is the number of vertices, and ${n}$ is the number of neighbors. This is supported by the fact that we must iterate over the edge list to construct the adjacency list representation of the graph.
