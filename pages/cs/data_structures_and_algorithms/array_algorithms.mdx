## Array Product

Let ${N}$ be an array of 32-bit integers ${(a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_i, \ldots, a_{n-1},)}$ where ${n \in \nat}$ is the length of ${N}$ and ${i}$ is an index less than ${n.}$ Then ${\df{prod}}$ returns an array ${A = (p_0, p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i, \ldots, p_{n-1})}$ where ${p_i}$ is a product of the array excluding ${p_i.}$
