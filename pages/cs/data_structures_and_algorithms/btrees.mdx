# B-Trees

In this chapter, we cover __B-trees__, also called _multiway search trees_.
Multiway search trees are what they sound like — they're search trees. We've
seen search trees before, namely the binary search tree:

<BinaryTree
 data={[
  [10, [8, 11]],
  [8, [7, 9]],
  [11, [null, 12]],
 ]}
 scale={60}
 tighten={20}
/>

With binary trees, we have the restriction that every node in the tree can
have, at most, two children. If we increased the number of keys, however,
then the number of children can also increase. This is precisely what
multiway search trees (_MWay trees_ for short) are supposed to accomplish:

<MTree
 data={[
  { child: { id: "A", keys: [13, 17] }, parent: "" },
  { child: { id: "B", keys: [1, 8] }, parent: "A" },
  { child: { id: "C", keys: [2, 3] }, parent: "A" },
  { child: { id: "D", keys: [4, 7] }, parent: "A" },
 ]}
 scale={60}
 height={80}
/>

In the MWay tree above, the root has two keys, allowing us to construct a
tree with three children. Because the tree now has three children, we say
that the above tree is an MWay tree of degree-3. Alternatively, the tree
above is also called a __2-3 tree__ (2 keys, degree 3).

## B-Trees

2-3 trees are _height-balanced search trees_. Below, is the same 2-3 tree
with the height-balance factors indicated:

<MTree
 data={[
  { child: { id: "A", keys: [13, 17] }, parent: "" },
  { child: { id: "B", keys: [1, 8] }, parent: "A" },
  { child: { id: "C", keys: [2, 3] }, parent: "A" },
  { child: { id: "D", keys: [4, 7] }, parent: "A" },
 ]}
 scale={60}
 height={80}
 markBalanceFactor={true}
/>

As such, they are members of the set of __B-trees__. B-trees are
height-balanced trees of any degree. Because of this classification, 2-3
trees can also be referred to as _B-trees of degree-3_. For readability,
we'll use the term 2-𝑛 tree, where 𝑛 is the degree of the B-tree.

## Properties of 2-n Trees

Alongside their height-balanced nature, 2-𝑛 trees have several other
properties that distinguish them from other trees. First, all the leaves of
a 2-𝑛 tree are positioned at the same level:

<MTree
 data={[
  { child: { id: "A", keys: [13, 17] }, parent: "" },
  { child: { id: "B", keys: [1, 8] }, parent: "A" },
  { child: { id: "C", keys: [2, 3] }, parent: "A" },
  { child: { id: "D", keys: [4, 7] }, parent: "A" },
 ]}
 scale={60}
 height={80}
 markLevels={true}
/>

Notice that all of the leaves in the tree above exist on the same level.
The second property is that every node in the 2-𝑛 tree has at _at least
half_ of 𝑛. In our example tree, we have ${n = 3.}$ Thus, each node must
have, at a minimum,

$$
 \left\lceil \dfrac{n}{2} \right\rceil = \left\lceil \dfrac{3}{2} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 1.5 \right\rceil = 2
$$

children.

__Ordered Children.__ A further property to observe with 2-𝑛 trees is that
each node's keys have a particular ordering. That is, given the tree:

<MTree
 data={[
  { child: { id: "A", keys: ["L1", "R2"] }, parent: "" },
  { child: { id: "B", keys: ["k1", "k2"] }, parent: "A" },
  { child: { id: "C", keys: ["k1", "k2"] }, parent: "A" },
  { child: { id: "D", keys: ["k1", "k2"] }, parent: "A" },
 ]}
 scale={60}
 height={80}
/>

each `k1` is always less than its parent's `L1`, and each `k2` is always
less than its parent's `R2.`

__No Duplicates.__ Like all other search trees, 2-𝑛 trees do not contain
duplicates. If a duplicate is encountered, it is _not_ inserted.

## Constructing a 2-3 Tree

To construct a 2-3 tree, we need a way to insert nodes. Say we wanted to
insert the following values:

$$
 \seq{20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 10, 15, 70, 80}
$$

The first key we encounter is 20. Our tree contains nothing, so we create a
node:

<Sequence data={[20]} scale={10} index={false} />

Next, we see 30. As we now have a non-empty tree, we follow this procedure
for insertion:

1. Check if the key is in the current node.
 1. If the key is in the right or left fields, return.
 2. Otherwise:
  1. If the key is less than the right field's value, search the right

We place this key in the node containing 20:

<Sequence data={[20, 30]} scale={15} index={false} />

Now 40. We can't insert this key into the node with 20 and 30, because this
is a 2-3 tree. We can only have 2 keys in a single node at most. So, we
have to split the node we already have, and create a new node for 40:

<Grid cols={3}>

<Sequence data={[20, " "]} scale={35} index={false} />

<Sequence data={[30, " "]} scale={35} index={false} />

<Sequence data={[40, " "]} scale={35} index={false} />

</Grid>

Next, we follow the ordered-property of 2-3 trees: We know that
${20 \ltn 30,}$ and ${30 \ltn 40.}$ So, the left-child of ${30}$ must be
${20,}$ and the right child of ${30}$ must be 40;

<MTree
 data={[
  { child: { id: "A", keys: [30, " "] }, parent: "" },
  { child: { id: "B", keys: [20, " "] }, parent: "A" },
  { child: { id: "C", keys: [40, " "] }, parent: "A" },
 ]}
 scale={80}
 height={80}
 width={250}
 tighten={30}
/>

Notice how this construction differs from the usual binary trees. We're
building from bottom to top, rather than top to bottom.

The next key is ${50.}$ We start at ${30,}$ and see that ${30 \ltn 50.}$
