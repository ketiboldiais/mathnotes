# Red-black Trees

<BinaryTree data={[

Red-black trees are a height-balanced binary search tree, much like 2-3 trees
and AVL trees. Its distinguishing properties are as follows:  

1. Every node has a color, red or black (in numeric terms, a `0` or `1`).
2. The tree's root is always black.
3. The null nodes are always black.
4. If a node is red, then its parent and its chilren must be black.
5. All newly inserted nodes are initially red.
6. The height ${\H}$ of a red-black tree is bounded as follows:
	$$
		\lg n \lte \H \lte 2 \lg n
	$$

## Insertion

To illustrate insertion, we use the following set of keys:

$$
	\set{10,20,30,50,40,60,70,80,4,8}
$$

Start with the first key, 10. This creates the node: 

<BinaryTree data={[
	[{val:10,focus:`black`}, [null,null]],
]}
scale={70}
height={50}
/>

Note that this node must have the color black, per _Property 2._ Next, we insert
the key 20:

<BinaryTree data={[
	[{val:10,focus:`black`}, [null,20]],
]}
scale={70}
edgeLength={20}
tighten={50}
height={50}
/>

Then we insert the key 30:

<BinaryTree data={[
	[{val:10,focus:`black`}, [null,20]],
	[20, [null,30]],
]}
scale={70}
edgeLength={40}
tighten={50}
height={70}
/>

Now we've run into trouble. Under _Property 4_, that 30 must be black. This
situation is called a __red-red conflict__. For brevity, we'll call the node
causing this conflict — here, 30 — the _rascal_. Red-red conflicts are resolved
through recoloring and rotation. We examine each in turn.

### Recoloring

The easiest approach is recoloring. To illustrate this approach, suppose we had
the following tree:

<BinaryTree data={[
	[{val:`g`,focus:`black`}, [`u`,`p`]],
	[`u`, [{val:`z`,label:true,focus:`black`},{val:`y`,label:true,focus:`black`}]],
	[`p`, [{val:`z`,label:true,focus:`black`},`n`]],
]}
scale={60}
/>

Above, we have a red-red conflict resulting from the rascal ${n.}$ ${n}$ has
the parent ${p,}$ the _pibling_ ${u,}$ and the _grandparent_ ${g.}$ In
recoloring, we perform the following procedure:

1. Starting from the rascal to the root:
	1. Change ${p}$'s color to black.
	2. Change ${u}$'s color to black.
	3. Change ${g}$'s color to red, unless ${g}$ is the root.

The end result:

<BinaryTree data={[
	[{val:`g`,focus:`black`}, [{val:`u`,focus:`black`},{val:`p`,focus:`black`}]],
	[`u`, [{val:`z`,label:true,focus:`black`},{val:`y`,label:true,focus:`black`}]],
	[`p`, [{val:`z`,label:true,focus:`black`},`n`]],
]}
scale={60}
/>

### Rotation

Recoloring only addresses the situation where the rascal has a pibling. It does
not address the situation where the rascal has no piblings. There are two such
cases:

<Grid cols={2}>

<BinaryTree data={[
	[{val:`g`,focus:`black`}, [{val:`u`,focus:`black`,label:true},`p`]],
	[`p`, [{val:`z`,label:true,focus:`black`},`n`]],
]}
scale={90}
/>

<BinaryTree data={[
	[{val:`g`,focus:`black`}, [{val:`u`,focus:`black`,label:true},`p`]],
	[`p`, [`n`, {val:`z`,label:true,focus:`black`}]],
]}
scale={90}
/>

<figcaption>case 1</figcaption>

<figcaption>case 2</figcaption>

</Grid>

For both cases, we must rotate, similar to how rotations are done with AVL
trees. In case 1, we perform a _zig-zig rotation_, and in case 2, we perform a
_zig-zag rotation_. The end result for both:

<BinaryTree data={[
	[{val:`g`,focus:`black`}, [`p`,`n`]],
]}
scale={60}
edgeLength={60}
tighten={50}
height={90}
/>

In sum, we have the following requirements during the insertion process:

1. If a red-red conflict occurs, do the following:
	1. If the rascal has a black pibling, perform a recoloring.
	2. Else:
		1. If the rascal is the left-child of its parent, perform a zig-zig
		rotation.
		2. If the rascal is the right-child of its parent, perform a zig-zag
		rotation.
		
Returning to our insertion process, we see that the rascal has no pibling and is
the right-child of its parent. So, we perform a zig-zag rotation (equivalent to
the RR-rotation we saw with AVL trees).

<BinaryTree data={[
	[{val:10,focus:`black`}, [20,30]],
	[30, [{val:`a`,focus:`black`,label:true},{val:`b`,focus:`black`,label:true}]],
	[20, [{val:`c`,focus:`black`,label:true},{val:`d`,focus:`black`,label:true}]],
]}
scale={60}
edgeLength={60}
tighten={50}
height={90}
/>

Now we add the next key, 50: 

<BinaryTree data={[
	[{val:10,focus:`black`}, [20,30]],
	[30, [{val:`a`,focus:`black`,label:true},50]],
	[20, [{val:`b`,focus:`black`,label:true},{val:`c`,focus:`black`,label:true}]],
]}
scale={60}
edgeLength={60}
tighten={50}
height={90}
/>

We have another red-red conflict. This time, the rascal has a pibling, and thati
pibling is red. Accordingly, we perform a _recoloring_:

<BinaryTree data={[
	[{val:10,focus:`black`}, [{val:20,focus:`black`},{val:30,focus:`black`}]],
	[30, [{val:`a`,focus:`black`,label:true},50]],
	[20, [{val:`b`,focus:`black`,label:true},{val:`c`,focus:`black`,label:true}]],
]}
scale={60}
edgeLength={60}
tighten={50}
height={90}
/>

Now we insert the next key, 40. This node becomes the left-child of 50:

<BinaryTree data={[
	[{val:10,focus:`black`}, [{val:20,focus:`black`},{val:30,focus:`black`}]],
	[30, [{val:`a`,focus:`black`,label:true},50]],
	[20, [{val:`b`,focus:`black`,label:true},{val:`c`,focus:`black`,label:true}]],
	[50, [40,{val:`d`,focus:`black`,label:true}]],
	[40, [{val:`e`,focus:`black`,label:true},{val:`f`,focus:`black`,label:true}]],
]}
scale={60}
edgeLength={90}
tighten={50}
height={120}
/>

We get another red-red conflict. The parent is red, and the rascal 40 has no
piblings. So, we perform a zig-zag rotation:

<BinaryTree data={[
	[{val:20,focus:`black`}, [{val:10,focus:`black`},{val:40,focus:`black`}]],
	[40, [30,50]],
	[30, [{val:`e`,focus:`black`,label:true},{val:`f`,focus:`black`,label:true}]],
	[50, [{val:`e`,focus:`black`,label:true},{val:`f`,focus:`black`,label:true}]],
	[10, [{val:`e`,focus:`black`,label:true},{val:`f`,focus:`black`,label:true}]],
]}
scale={60}
edgeLength={90}
tighten={50}
height={120}
/>
