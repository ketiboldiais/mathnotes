# Summary

## Abstract Data Type vs. Data Structures

An abstract data type defines a collection of valid operations and their
behaviors on stored data. It provides an interface (API) for storing,
organizing, and manipulating data. To implement the abstract data type, we
use a _data structure_.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a well-defined procedure that solves a computational
problem. It does so by transforming a given input data into a desired
output or answer.

## Data Structures

Broadly, data structures fall into two categories:

1. __contiguous data structures__ (e.g., static arrays, dynamic arrays),
   and
2. __connected data structures__ (e.g., linked lists, trees, graphs)

In selecting a data structure, we have to make a few considerations:

1. How much _time_ is needed to perform the operation?
2. How much _space_ is needed to perform an operation?
3. How does input size affect the results?

### Example

Consider a singly-linked list with ${n}$ elements. How many operations are
needed to insert a value at the end of the singly-linked list?

Answer: Let's consider a simpler case. If there are three nodes, then we
can count nine steps. For each node, we have to (1) access the node, and
(2) check if the node has a null pointer. This yields 6 steps. If all of
the nodes are safe (no node has a null pointer), we get to the last node,
and perform three steps: (1) create the node, (2) insert the value, and (3)
update the pointer. This yields 6 + 3 = 9 steps total. We can generalize
this as:

$$
	T(n) = 2n + 3
$$

This tells us that the insertion into a linked list takes linear time. If
we doubled the size of our linked list, we can expect that it would take us
double the amount of time to insert, and if we tripled the size of our
linked list, triple the amount of time.

## Stacks

Stacks are LIFO (last-in-first-out) data structure. They implement the
following API:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Method</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>`push(object)`</td>
			<td>Add an object to the top of the stack.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`pop(object)`</td>
			<td>Remove the current object at the top of the stack.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`object &top()`</td>
			<td>Return a reference to the top element.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`size()`</td>
			<td>Return the number of elements in the stack.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`isEmpty()`</td>
			<td>Checks if the stack has no elements.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

Use cases for the stack include:

- A web browser's "back" feature,
- a text editor's "undo" feature,
- function calls in a virtual machine/C++

### Implementations

There are two kinds of stack implementations:

1. An array-based stack (also called _static stacks_),
2. A vector-based stack (_dynamic stacks_), and
3. A list-based stack (_dynamic stacks_),

#### Static Stacks

The array-based stack is a stack implemented with a static array. And
because its implemented with a static array, array-based stacks have a
fixed size.

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Method</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>`push(object)`</td>
			<td>
				<ol>
					<li>Check that the stack's height is less than its capacity.</li>
					<li>
						If it's less than the capacity, we can go ahead and push.
						Otherwise, throw an error.
					</li>
					<li>Use the `top_pointer` to add an element.</li>
					<li>Increment the `top_pointer`.</li>
				</ol>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`pop(object)`</td>
			<td>Decrement the top pointer.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`object &top()`</td>
			<td>Dereference the `top_pointr - 1`.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`size()`</td>
			<td>Subtract `base_pointer` from the `top_pointer`.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`isEmpty()`</td>
			<td>Checks if the stack has no elements.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

For array-based stacks (static or dynamic), we always have the
`top_pointer` pointing just past the last element in the array data
structure:

<Sequence
	data={[1, 2, 3, "", "", ""]}
	arrayPointers={[
		{ text: "b", target: 0 },
		{ text: "t", target: 3 },
	]}
	scale={30}
/>

#### Vector-based Dynamic Stacks

Dynamic stacks are stacks that do not have a fixed size.

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Method</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>`push(object)`</td>
			<td>
				<ol>
					<li>If needed, allocate a bigger array and copy data.</li>
					<li>Use the `top_pointer` to add an element.</li>
					<li>Increment the `top_pointer`.</li>
				</ol>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`pop(object)`</td>
			<td>Decrement the top pointer.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`object &top()`</td>
			<td>Dereference the `top_pointr - 1`.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`size()`</td>
			<td>Subtract `base_pointer` from the `top_pointer`.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`isEmpty()`</td>
			<td>Checks if the stack has no elements.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

### List-based Dynamic Stacks

The alternative to a vector-based stack is a list-based stack:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Method</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>`push(object)`</td>
			<td>
				<ol>
					<li>Insert a new node at the `head_ptr`.</li>
					<li>Delete the node at `head_ptr`.</li>
					<li>Increment `size`.</li>
				</ol>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`pop(object)`</td>
			<td>Delete the node at `head_ptr`. Decrement the size.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`object &top()`</td>
			<td>Dereference `head_ptr`.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`size()`</td>
			<td>Return `size`.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`isEmpty()`</td>
			<td>Check if `size == 0` or `head_ptr == nullptr`.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td colSpan={2}>
				*Alternatively: Get rid of the `size` variable, count the nodes
				each time.
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

### Comparing the Approaches

From a high-level view, the three implementations aren't that different.
However, at a lower level, arrays largely outperform linked lists. While
the time complexities are largely ${O(1),}$ (constant time), arrays will
have smaller constants than linked lists. Moreover, linked lists have a
higher memory overhead — they require more space and require further
operations for memory allocation and management.

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th colSpan={4}>__Time Complexities__</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Method</th>
			<th>Static Stack</th>
			<th>Vector-based Dynamic Stack</th>
			<th>List-based Dynamic Stack</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>`push(object)`</td>
			<td>${O(1)}$</td>
			<td>
				${O(n)}$ (averages out to an amortized constant with many pushes)
			</td>
			<td>${O(1)}$</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`pop(object)`</td>
			<td>${O(1)}$</td>
			<td>${O(1)}$</td>
			<td>${O(1)}$</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`object &top(object)`</td>
			<td>${O(1)}$</td>
			<td>${O(1)}$</td>
			<td>${O(1)}$</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`size()`</td>
			<td>${O(1)}$</td>
			<td>${O(1)}$</td>
			<td>
				${O(1)}$ (if size is tracked); ${O(n)}$ if size is untracked
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`empty()`</td>
			<td>${O(1)}$</td>
			<td>${O(1)}$</td>
			<td>${O(1)}$</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

The C++ standard library provides a stack. We can use it by writing:

```cpp
#include <stack>
```

The default underlying container is a `std::deque<>` (a double-ended
queue), but we can specify two other containers `std::list<>` (a
doubly-linked list) or `std::vector<>` (a dynamic array).

## Queues

The queue is another basic container. In contrast to the stack, the queue
is a FIFO data structure — first in, first out. The general API:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Method</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>`enqueue(object)`</td>
			<td>Add an element to the back of the queue.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`dequeue`</td>
			<td>Remove the element at the front of the queue.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`object &front()`</td>
			<td>Return a reference to the element at the front of the queue.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`size()`</td>
			<td>Return the number of elements in the queue.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`isEmpty()`</td>
			<td>Check if the queue has no elements</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

Examples of queue usages include:

- Adding songs to the end of the "play next" playlist
- Routers determining which network packet to send next
