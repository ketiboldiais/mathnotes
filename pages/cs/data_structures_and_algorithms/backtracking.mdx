# Backtracking

Backtracking is a form of recursion ‚Äî using recursion, we assign values to
variables, one variable at a time.[^cite_bt] It's commonly used to solve a
CSPs:

> __Definition: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP).__ A CSP is a
> problem that takes the following form: Given ${n}$ variables and ${L}$
> labels, assign each of the variables a label, subject to restrictions
> (called _constraints_). The restrictions specify what combinations of
> labels are allowed for some subset of the variables.[^cite_csp]

From the definition above, we can think of many problems that can be
restated as CSPs:

1. Combinatorical optimization problems (e.g., the travelling salesman
   problem).
2. Sudoku puzzles
3. The ùëÅ-queens problem
4. Various optimization problems

Question: Couldn't we solve these problems with iteration? We could, but it
would be unwieldy. From the definition above, solving a CSP via iteration ‚Äî
say, brute force ‚Äî requires our algorithm to evaluate all the possible
assignments (or states). For some problems, many of those evaluations are
wasteful. Midway through the process, it's apparent that the current
assignment is bad (violates a constraint). Unfortunately, because of the
way CSPs are, there's usually no easy way to stop the evaluation midway.
Recursion, however, handles this problem easily ‚Äî _return on the base
case_.

Details may be hazy at this point, so let's clarify with some analogy.

## Backtracking & Depth-first Search

Backtracking is analogous to a depth-first search for a solution. Say we
had some CSP. In backtracking, we imagine treat the CSP as a _constraint
tree_ (or more generally, a _constraint graph_):

<BinaryTree
	data={[
		[" ", ["A", "B"]],
		["A", ["C", "D"]],
		["B", ["E", "F"]],
		["C", ["G", "H"]],
		["D", ["I", { val: "J", focus: "blue" }]],
		["E", ["K", "L"]],
		["F", ["M", "N"]],
	]}
	cwidth={10}
	scale={50}
/>

Each of the nodes represent a variable, and each edge represents a
constraint. That constraint could be anything: "If there's an edge, these
two variables _can't_ be assigned together", "If there's an edge, these two
variables _can_ be assigned together", etc.

Viewed this way, we see why backtracking has advantages over traditional
iterative methods. If we encounter a particular node (a particular
subtree), we can immediately abandon the search for a solution altogether.
For example, in the tree above, suppose the correct solution is `J`. We
start from the root, and traverse the entire tree (the set of all possible
solutions). Say we get all the way down `G`. At that point, we make a
determination: Is this a good state or a bad state? I.e., is the path I've
taken from the root down to this node (`root--A--C--G`) satisfactory
(doesn't violate the constraints)? No. So, we _backtrack_ to the parent
node, `C`, and report that the path is not a valid assignment. This report
goes up to `A`, which then determines: "`C`, you are not a valid
assignment. Don't bother to continue searching." So, the search goes down
to `D`, and eventually to `J`, the correct solution.

Where backtracking takes a depth-first search, the brute-force approach
takes a bread-first search. To find the correct solution `J`, we check each
node at each level, one by one: `A`, then `B`, then `C`, then `D`, then
`E`, etc.

| Approach     | Path                | Total Checks |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Backtracking | `G-C-A-I-D-J`       | 6            |
| Brute-force  | `A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I` | 9            |

The difference doesn't seem like much (we've purposely kept the solution
close for readability) but it's not difficult to imagine a CSP where the
correct solution is at the right-most leaf node of some gargantuan tree.
Or, worse, if the correct solution doesn't exist at all.

Importantly, many CSPs have a runtime complexity of ${O(n!).}$ While
backtracking doesn't always evade this upperbound, it can certainly reduce
the number of steps necessary. That said, there are some problems (as we'll
see shortly) that cannot get around this bound ‚Äî it would take years, if
not decades, to find a solution.

## The N-queens Problem

To understand the N-queens problem, recall that a queen can move in any of
these directions:

1. ${n}$ squares to the left.
2. ${n}$ squares to the right.
3. ${n}$ squares forwards.
4. ${n}$ squares backwards.
5. ${n}$ squares diagonally.

With this in mind, the N-queens problem asks the following:

> Given an ${N \times N}$ chessboard, how many ways can we place ${N}$
> queens such that no two queens can threaten one another?

To start, let's say we have a ${4 \times 4}$ board:

<BoxMatrix
	data={[
		[0, 0, 0, 0],
		[0, 0, 0, 0],
		[0, 0, 0, 0],
		[0, 0, 0, 0],
	]}
/>

We place queens column by column, then row by row. Our first column is 0,
so we place a queen there:

<BoxMatrix
	data={[
		["Q_1", 0, 0, 0],
		[0, 0, 0, 0],
		[0, 0, 0, 0],
		[0, 0, 0, 0],
	]}
/>

Let's cross out all the spaces that subsequent queens can't occupy:

<BoxMatrix
	data={[
		["Q_1", "‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
		["‚®â", "‚®â", 0, 0],
		["‚®â", 0, "‚®â", 0],
		["‚®â", 0, 0, "‚®â"],
	]}
/>

Now we place a second queen at column 2, again, crossing out all the paths
again:

<BoxMatrix
	data={[
		["Q_1", "‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
		["‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â", 0],
		["‚®â", "Q_2", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
		["‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
	]}
/>

Now we try to place a third queen ‚Äî we can't. Column 3 is covered entirely
in ${Q_1}$ and ${Q_2}$'s paths. So, we have to _backtrack_ to ${Q_2,}$ and
increment their position:

<BoxMatrix
	data={[
		["Q_1", "‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
		["‚®â", "‚®â", 0, "‚®â"],
		["‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â", 0],
		["‚®â", "Q_2", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
	]}
/>

We now consider ${Q_3}$ again. Now we have a space:

<BoxMatrix
	data={[
		["Q_1", "‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
		["‚®â", "‚®â", "Q_3", "‚®â"],
		["‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
		["‚®â", "Q_2", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
	]}
/>

When we get to ${Q_4,}$ we find ourselves in trouble again ‚Äî no spaces. So,
we backtrack to ${Q_3.}$ We try incrementing ${Q_3}$'s position, and find
that we can't. So, we backtrack again to ${Q_2.}$ When we get to ${Q_2,}$
we again find that we can't increment ${Q_2}$'s position, so we backtrack
again to ${Q_1,}$ and increment their position:

<BoxMatrix
	data={[
		["‚®â", "‚®â", 0, 0],
		["Q_1", "‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
		["‚®â", "‚®â", 0, 0],
		["‚®â", 0, "‚®â", 0],
	]}
/>

We get back to ${Q_2,}$ and use the last position, since that's the only
available space:

<BoxMatrix
	data={[
		["‚®â", "‚®â", 0, 0],
		["Q_1", "‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
		["‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â", 0],
		["‚®â", "Q_2", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
	]}
/>

We get to ${Q_3,}$ and use the first position, since that's the only
available space:

<BoxMatrix
	data={[
		["‚®â", "‚®â", "Q_3", "‚®â"],
		["Q_1", "‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
		["‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â", 0],
		["‚®â", "Q_2", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
	]}
/>

Finally, we get to ${Q_4,}$ and use the second-to last space, since that's
the only available space:

<BoxMatrix
	data={[
		["‚®â", "‚®â", "Q_3", "‚®â"],
		["Q_1", "‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
		["‚®â", "‚®â", "‚®â", "Q_4"],
		["‚®â", "Q_2", "‚®â", "‚®â"],
	]}
/>

If we were to use an iterative approach, we'd have to check
all of the nodes in this search tree:
