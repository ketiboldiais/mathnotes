# Shortest Path Algorithms


Let's consider the problem of finding the shortest path between vertices ${a}$ and ${b}$ given an edge list. Let's start by considering an example. Suppose we're given the following graph.

<Grid cols={2}>
<Graph data={[
	{link:['w', 'x']},
	{link:['x', 'y']},
	{link:['y', 'z']},
	{link:['v', 'z']},
	{link:['v', 'w']},
]}
id={`spf1`}
repulsion={0.3}
collisionRadius={15}
edgeLength={12}
straightEdges={true}
scale={50}
width={100}
height={55}/>

$$
	\lset{\ax{
		w &\mapsto& \ix{x,w} \\ 
		x &\mapsto& \ix{w,y} \\
		y &\mapsto& \ix{x} \\ 
		v &\mapsto& \ix{z,w} \\
		z &\mapsto& \ix{v} \\
	}}
$$

</Grid>

There are two possible paths to get to ${z:}$

$$
	P_1 = \ar{w,x,y,z} ~~~~~ P_2 \ar{w,v,z}
$$

We see that ${P_2}$  is the shorter path, compared to ${P_1.}$ Our task is to find such a ${P_2,}$ if it exists, and return its length. This problem is a good example of where BFT is easier to work with than DFT. Recall that with BFT, we _spread as far as we can_ from the starting vertex before moving on to the next vertex, and with DFT, we traverse _plunge as deep as we can_. This means that, with DFT, we'd have to run along a potentially very long path before ever hitting the path's end.

> __~shortest-path~.__ Let ${G}$ be a nonempty graph, represented as an adjacency list. The function ${\df{spath}}$ takes ${G}$ and a pair of vertices ${(src,dst),}$ and returns an nonnegative integer ${n}$ corresponding to the shortest path between ${a}$ and ${b}$ on ${G,}$ and ${-1}$ if no such path exists.
