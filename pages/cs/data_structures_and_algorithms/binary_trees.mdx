# Binary Trees


## Static Binary Trees

As its name implies, an __array-implemented binary tree (ABT)__ is a binary
tree implemented, and represented, with an array. First, we have the
following binary tree, with an accompanying empty array:

<BinaryTree
	data={[
		["A", ["B", "C"]],
		["B", ["D", "E"]],
		["C", ["F", "G"]],
	]}
/>

<Sequence data={[" ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "]} scale={50} />

The challenge: How do we store each node in this binary tree in the array
such that the relationships between the nodes are preserved? For example,
`B` is the left child of `A`, and `C` is the right child of `A`. How is
that information preserved in an array implementation?

Here's an idea: Use the array's indices. Let's start by storing the
elements from the top generation to the bottom generation, left to right.
At ${L = 1,}$ we have a single node, `A`. So we store in the array:

<Sequence data={["A", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "]} scale={50} />

At ${L = 2,}$ we have two nodes, `B` and `C`, so we store, from left to
right, `B` then `C`:

<Sequence data={["A", "B", "C", " ", " ", " ", " "]} scale={50} />

Then, we go on to ${L = 3,}$ and see that there are ${4}$ nodes &mdash;
`D`, `E`, `F`, and `G`. Again we store the nodes from left to right:

<Sequence data={["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"]} scale={50} />

Let's construct a table to see if we can find a pattern. Suppose ${i}$ is
an index in the array, ${i_L}$ is the index of the left child, and ${i_R}$
is the index of the right child.

| Element | ${i}$ | ${i_L}$         | ${i_R}$         |
| ------- | ----- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `A`     | ${0}$ | ${1}$           | ${2}$           |
| `B`     | ${1}$ | ${3}$           | ${4}$           |
| `C`     | ${2}$ | ${5}$           | ${6}$           |
| `D`     | ${3}$ | ${\varnothing}$ | ${\varnothing}$ |
| `E`     | ${4}$ | ${\varnothing}$ | ${\varnothing}$ |
| `F`     | ${5}$ | ${\varnothing}$ | ${\varnothing}$ |
| `G`     | ${6}$ | ${\varnothing}$ | ${\varnothing}$ |

Examining the table, we see that at the first generation, the element's
left child is offset by ${1,}$ and its right child is offset by ${2.}$ For
the left node on the second generation, the element's left child is offset
by ${2}$ and its right child is offset by ${3.}$ For the right node on the
second generation, the element's left child is offset by ${3}$ and its
right child is offset by ${4.}$ Examining these mappings we that, to get
the left child, we use:

$$
	i_L = 2i + 1
$$

and to get the right child, we use:

$$
	i_R = 2i + 2
$$

These two formulas allow us to access the left and right children. But what
about the parents? Well, let's construct another table, where ${i_P}$ is
the index of the given element's parent.

| Element | ${i}$ | ${i_P}$         |
| ------- | ----- | --------------- |
| `A`     | ${0}$ | ${\varnothing}$ |
| `B`     | ${1}$ | ${0}$           |
| `C`     | ${2}$ | ${0}$           |
| `D`     | ${3}$ | ${1}$           |
| `E`     | ${4}$ | ${1}$           |
| `F`     | ${5}$ | ${2}$           |
| `G`     | ${6}$ | ${2}$           |

Examining this table, we see that given an element with the index ${i,}$
the index of its parent is:

$$
	i_P = \left\lfloor \dfrac{i}{2} \right\rfloor
$$

This is a fairly useful piece of information, so we state it as a lemma:

> __lemma__. Let ${A}$ be an array representing an array-implemented binary
> tree, and ${i}$ an index in the array. Given a branch node ${A[i],}$ the
> left child of ${A[i]}$ has the index ${i_L,}$ where
>
> $$
> 	  i_L = 2i + 1
> $$
>
> and the right child of ${A[i]}$ has the index ${i_R,}$ where
>
> $$
> 	  i_R = 2i + 2
> $$

## Dynamic Binary Trees

The _linked-list-implemented binary tree (LBT)_ looks similar to a
general linked list in implementation. Usually, there's a _root pointer_, a
pointer in the stack whose pointee is the _root_ of the binary tree. For
the binary tree, each node has ${2}$ _next fields_ &mdash; one for a
`leftChild` pointer and one for the `rightChild` pointer, and ${1}$ _data
field_. Furthermore, each node in the tree, other than the root node, is
the lone pointee of another node.

Above, we see that each node is a square comprised of one left compartment
and one right compartment, beneath a larger compartment. The larger
compartment is called the data field, and stores the substantive data. The
left compartment houses the left subtree pointer, and the right compartment
houses the right subtree pointer.

For example, suppose we had the following binary tree:

<BinaryTree
	data={[
		["A", ["B", "C"]],
		["B", ["D", "E"]],
		["C", ["F", "G"]],
	]}
/>

This tree would be implemented as:

	}
	caption={"The tree's implementation"}
	width={50}
	imwidth={905}
	imheight={740}
/>

If we look at the representation, we see that there are ${7}$ nodes,
corresponding to the ${7}$ elements we seek to store. Notice that with
${7}$ nodes, there are ${8}$ null pointers. If there are ${N}$ nodes, then
are ${N + 1}$ null pointers.

To begin, we need to implement the basic ~node~ data structure, as we saw
with linked lists, along with its constructor in pseudocode:

<Obj>

- __structure__ ${\df{node}}$ __contains__
	1. ${\df{comparable} ~ \tx{datum}}$
	2. ${\df{node}^* ~ \tx{left-child}}$
	3. ${\df{node}^* ~ \tx{right-child}}$
- __end__


</Obj>

We'll define the ~binary tree~ data structure separately:

<Obj>

- __structure__ ${\df{binary-tree}}$ __contains__
	1. ${\df{node}^* ~ root}$
- __end__


</Obj>


## Node Insertion

Below is one approach to inserting a new node into a binary tree, using the structural definitions for ~node~ and ~binary-tree~ provided previously.

<Algo>

__Binary Tree Node Insertion__
- __Identifier__: ~insert~
- __Preconditions:__
	- Structure ${\df{node}}$ is defined.
	- Structure ${\df{binary-tree}}$ is defined.
- __Input:__
	- ${\df{binary-tree}^*}$ ${t}$, the insertion's targeted tree.
	- ${\df{comparable}}$ ${d}$, the inserted node's data.
- __Output:__ ${\df{binary-tree}^*}$

1. __if__ ${~ {t} \ix{\tx{root}} = \nil ~}$ __then__
	1. __init__ ${\df{node}^*}$ ${\let{n}{\df{node}(d)}}$
	2. ${{t} \ix{\tx{root}} \gets n}$
2. __else__
	1. __init__ ${\df{node}^*}$ ${p \gets {t} \ix{\tx{root}}}$
	2. __init__ ${\df{node}^*}$ ${r \gets \nil}$
	3. __while__ ${p \neq \nil}$ __do__
		1. ${r \gets p}$
		2. __if__ ${{d} \lt p \ix{\tx{datum}}}$ __then__ ${p \gets p \ix{\tx{left-child}}}$
		3. __else if__ ${{d} \gt p \ix{\tx{datum}}}$ __then__ ${p \gets p \ix{\tx{right-child}}}$
		4. __else__ __return__ ${t}$
	4. ${p \gets \df{node}({d})}$
	5. __if__ ${{d} \lt r \ix{\tx{datum}}}$ __then__ ${r \gets p \ix{\tx{left-child}}}$
	6. __else__ ${r \ix{\tx{right-child}} \gets p}$
3. __return__ ${t}$ ${\blacksquare}$

</Algo>

The procedure here is fairly straightforward. ~insert~ takes two arguments, ${t}$ and ${d.}$ ${t}$ is the tree the new node will be inserted into, and ${d}$ is the accompanying data value. By definition, ${t}$ is either null or nonnull. This yields a clear branch in the procedure: One branch handles the null case, the other the nonnull case.

We handle the first case starting at line zero and ending at line two. If the root of ${t}$ is undefined, then we instantiate a new node ${n,}$ initialize its data value to ${d,}$ and assign ${n}$ as the root. Note that in languages like C, line one may be a cause for concern. As is, the procedure above makes no checks for potential memory allocation failures.  

The second case is where the tree argument is not null. ~insert~ handles this starting at line three. This part of the procedure is a bit more involved. First, we need two nodes ${p}$ and ${r.}$ We bind the ${t}$'s root to ${p,}$ and ${\nil}$ to ${r.}$ Since we only entered the branch because ${t}$ was nonnull, we can infer that ${p}$ starts with some nonnull value. From there, we enter the while loop.
