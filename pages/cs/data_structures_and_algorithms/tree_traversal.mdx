# Tree Traversal

To _traverse_ a data structure is to visit, or read, all of the structure's
elements. In a linear data structure like an array, there are two traversal
approaches:

1. First to last (called __forward-linear traversal__), or
2. last to first (__backward-linear traversal__).

Data structures like binary trees, however, are non-linear. And because
they're non-linear, they have several traversal approaches:

1. __Depth-first search (DFS)__ &mdash; traversing the tree by starting at
   the root, and exploring as far as possible along each _branch_ before
   backtracing.

2. __Breadth-first search (BFS)__ &mdash; traversing the tree by starting
   at the root, and exploring all nodes at the present level before moving
   to nodes at a subsequent level.

Both approaches have several sub-approaches:

1. Depth-first search:
   1. _preorder traversal_
   2. _inorder traversal_
   3. _postorder traversal_
2. Bread-first search:
   1. _level/generational traversal_ and variations

We examine each of these traversal approaches in turn.
