# Sorting Algorithms

The operation of __sorting__ is to rearrange a sequence of items into a
specified rule of order (most commonly numeric ascending order; i.e., least
to greatest). The notes below cover a suite of sorting algorithms.

## Bubble Sort

In computer science courses, bubble sort is often the first introduction to
sorting, so we start here. The implementation:

```rust
bubbleSort(array):
	for (int i = array.length,  i > 0,  i--):
		for (int j = 0,  j < i,  j++):
			if (array[j+1] < array[j]):
				swap(array[j+1], array[j])
	return array
```

Here's a visual, sorting the array `[-1,2,9,7,8,4]`.

| pass | step | array             | array[j] | array[j+1] | swapped |
| ---- | ---- | ----------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 1    | 1    | [8,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] | 8        | 1          | 1 and 8 |
|      | 2    | [1,8,2,3,4,5,6,7] | 8        | 2          | 2 and 8 |
|      | 3    | [1,2,8,3,4,5,6,7] | 8        | 3          | 3 and 8 |

The idea behind bubble sort: We move through the array, comparing the
current element at index ${i}$ (${n_i}$) against the element at index
${i+1}$ (${n_{i+1}.}$) If ${n_{i+1} > {n_{i}},}$ we swap the two elements.
In the table, the pass column indicates one complete loop through the
array. Notice that we loop through the array 7 times. This follows from the
fact that the algorithm just swaps adjacent elements. The algorithm has no
data about whether the entire array is sorted. All it does is loop,
compare, compare, compare, ..., loop, compare, compare, compare, ..., swap
if need be.

This is inefficient. After the first pass, the array is completely sorted.
We're wasting both time and processor resources by continuing to loop and
compare. We can fix this somewhat with the following change, a tiny
optimization that requires additional memory:

```rust
bubbleSort(array):
	let noSwap
	for (int i = array.length,  i > 0,  i--):
		noSwap = true
		for (int j = 0,  j < i,  j++):
			if (array[j+1] < array[j]):
				swap(array[j+1], array[j])
				noSwap = false
			if (noSwap) break
	return array
```

| pass | step | array             | array[j] | array[j+1] | swapped |

|      | 3    | [1,2,8,3,4,5,6,7] | 8        | 3          | 3 and 8 |
|      | 4    | [1,2,3,8,4,5,6,7] | 8        | 4          | 4 and 8 |

| 2    | 8    | [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] | 1        | 2          | none    |
|      | 9    | break             | ~        | ~          | ~       |

| 4    | 12   | [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] | 1        | 2          | none    |
|      | 13   | break             | ~        | ~          | ~       |
| 5    | 14   | [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] | 1        | 2          | none    |

| 7    | 18   | [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] | 1        | 2          | none    |
|      | 19   | break             | ~        | ~          | ~       |

By introducing a `noSwap` variable, we've cut down on the amount of steps
from 28 to 19. The `noSwap` variable effectively tells the algorithm not to
continue in the inner loop if no swap was performed. This gets straight to
our previous annoyance: If no swap was performed, we know that the elements
are sorted, so there's no need to continue looping.

## Selection Sort

Closely related to bubble sort is selection sort. The implementation:
