# Caches

The following are a few notes on cache-like data structures.

## LRU Cache

The _Least Recently Used (LRU) cache_ is a dynamic data structure designed to remove elements when full, discarding the least recently used items first. As an example, suppose we used some sequential structure:

$$
	\mx{
		\nil & \nil & \nil & \nil
	}.
$$

Initially, the cache is empty, with a fixed-size of four. Each time we use a value we want cached, the value is pushed onto the array. Say we used 1: 

$$
	\mx{
		1 & \nil & \nil & \nil
	}.
$$

Continuing the usage, at some point, we end up with a full cache:

$$
	\mx{
		1 & 2 & 3 & 4
	}.
$$
