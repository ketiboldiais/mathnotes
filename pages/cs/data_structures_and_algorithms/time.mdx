# Time Algorithms

A _time algorithm_ is an algorithm associated with parsing, manipulating,
computing, and more generally working with, time formats. To begin, we'll
start by presenting the two principle source of issues for time algorithms:
(1) units of time, and (2) linguistic fence post problems.

## Units of Time

Here is an overview of the various ways we can measure time:

<DataTable
	data={[
		["Name", "Length", "Remark"],
		["nanosecond", "1 ns, 0.000 000 001 s", "One billionth of a second"],
		["microsecond", "1 ¬µs, 0.000 001 s", "One millionth of a second"],
		["millisecond", "1 ms, 0.001 s", "One thousandth of a second"],
		[
			"jiffy",
			"1/60 s or 1/50 s",
			`Used in electronics; also, "I'll be back in a jiffy"`,
		],
		["second", "1 s", "SI base unit for time"],
		["minute", "60 s", ""],
		["hour", "1 hr, 60 min, 120 s", ""],
		["day", "1 d, 24 hr, 1440 min, 86400 s", ""],
		["week", "1 w, 7 d, 168 hr, 10080 min, 604800 s", ""],
		["month", "1 mo, [28, 31] d", ""],
		["semester", "18 w", ""],
		["year", "1 yr, [365, 366] d", ""],
		["common year", "1 yr, 52 w, 365 d", ""],
		["leap year", "1 yr 1 d, 52 w + 2 d, 366 d", ""],
		["olympiad", "4 yr", ""],
		[
			"lustrum",
			"5 yr",
			"During the Roman empire, the interval between censuses",
		],
		["decade", "10 yr", ""],
		[
			"indiction",
			"15 yr",
			"During the Roman empire, the interval between tax assessments",
		],
		["jubilee", "50 yr", ""],
		["century", "100 yr", ""],
		["millennium", "1000 yr", ""],
		["megaannum", "1 Ma, 1000 millenia", "1 million years"],
		[
			"galactic year",
			"1 gy",
			"The amount of time it takes the solar system to orbit the Milky Way Galaxy's center. Roughly 230 million years.",
		],
	]}
/>

The table above is just a subset of the units of time used by humans. This
presents the first difficulty with handling time data: the sheer number of
time units to consider. For a time algorithm to be correct, it work with
time units correctly.

## Linguistic Fence Posts

The second problem presented is th _linguistic fence post_. This problem
stems from the way we use language. For example, when we say:

> "ùê¥ is due within 2 days of ${x}$."

There are two possible meanings.

1. If we count ${x}$ as ${\text{date}_0:}$

   $$
   	\tt{date}_0, \tt{date}_1, \cancel{\tt{date}_2}
   $$

   meaning, ùê¥ is due on ${x + 1.}$ This is the day after ${x.}$

2. If, however, we don't count ${x:}$

   $$
   	\cancel{\tt{date}_0}, \tt{date}_1, \tt{date}_2
   $$

   meaning, ùê¥ is due on ${x + 2.}$ This is two days after ${x.}$ $$

Moreover, depending on the context, we might have additional parameters: Do
we count weekends? Do we count holidays? Is the day 24 hours or business
days (8 hours)? The same problem exists when we say:

> "ùê¥ is due in 2 days."

Suppose that we're told the above on date ${y.}$

1. If we count ${y:}$

   $$
   	\tt{date}_0, \tt{date}_1, \cancel{\tt{date}_2}
   $$

   meaning, ùê¥ is due on ${y + 1.}$ This is the day after ${y.}$

2. If we don't count ${y:}$

   $$
   	\cancel{\tt{date}_0}, \tt{date}_1, \tt{date}_2
   $$

   meaning, ùê¥ is due on ${y + 2.}$ This is two days after ${x.}$ $$

Unfortunately, the only way to be absolutely certain of the intended
meaning is through specification.

## Wrap-around Counting

A common operation in time algorithms is modular arithmetic. Accordingly,
it's imperative that we have a strong understanding of the operation.

First, **modular arithmetic** is a system of arithmetic for the _integers_.
The arithmetic we're taught in elementary school is a system of arithmetic
for the _reals_ (or, at least a subset of the reals ‚Äî it's unlikely that
we're having children add gargantuan numbers). In real arithmetic, the
result of an operation could be _any_ real number: either 0, negative, or
positive.

In modular arithmetic, the result of an operation will "wrap around" a
certain value once it reaches a particular integer called the **modulus**.
Let's illustrate with the classic example, the wall clock.

A wall clock displays 12 hours:

<CircularQueue data={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]} scale={70} />

Let's say the current time is 8:00am. We'll mark at as `x`.

<CircularQueue
	data={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, { val: 8, ant: "x" }, 9, 10, 11, 12]}
	scale={70}
/>

3 hours later, we land at 11:

<CircularQueue
	data={[
		1,
		2,
		3,
		4,
		5,
		6,
		7,
		{ val: 8, ant: "x" },
		9,
		10,
		{ val: 11, ant: "x+3" },
		12,
	]}
	scale={70}
/>

In another 3 hours, (11+3), we land at 2:

<CircularQueue
	data={[
		1,
		{ val: 2, ant: "x+6" },
		3,
		4,
		5,
		6,
		7,
		{ val: 8, ant: "x" },
		9,
		10,
		{ val: 11, ant: "x+3" },
		12,
	]}
	scale={70}
/>

Thus, we have: ${8 + 6 = 2.}$ This is what we mean by modular arithmetic.
For the wall clock, the modulus is ${12.}$ Moreover, we say that this is
**mod-12 arithmetic**, or **arithmetic mod-12**: For all arithmetic
operations, once a result's value hits ${12,}$ its value starts back at the
initial value.

Having seen the basic example, let's add a little more detail.

#### Week Day Determining

Consider the following problem:

> **problem.** Today is Tuesday. What day will it be in 17 days?

Let's start by assigning each day of the week an index, starting at 0:

<CircularQueue
	data={["SU", "MO", "TU", "WE", "TH", "FR", "SA"]}
	scale={70}
	index={true}
/>

Here, the modulus is 7. If we viewed the diagram above as an array, this
corresponds to the array's length:

<StaticArray
	data={["SU", "MO", "TU", "WE", "TH", "FR", "SA"]}
	scale={40}
/>

$$
	\mm{L} = 7
$$

To determine the weekday 17 days from Tuesday, we first determine Tuesday's
index. Here, it's 2.

$$
	\mm{i} = 2
$$

Then, we add the 17 days to 2:

$$
	\mm{i} + 17 = 19
$$

Next, we divide this result by the modulus (the array's length) and obtain
the remainder:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\dfrac{\mm{i} + 17}{\mm{L}} &= \dfrac{19}{7} \\[1em]
	&= 2 \mm{rem} 5
\end{aligned}
$$

What does this tell us? It tells us that we've gone through 2 cycles plus 5
positions. That is, we've wrapped around the circulary array 2 timesputting
us at `SU`, then 5 extra, which is `FRI`.

Here's a simple implementation of a function for answering the problem
using TypeScript:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```typescript
type Weekday =
  | 'Sunday'   | 'Monday' | 'Tuesday'  | 'Wednesday'
  | 'Thursday' | 'Friday' | 'Saturday';

function WhichDay(currentDay: Weekday, days: number) {
  const weekdays = [
    'Sunday'   , 'Monday' , 'Tuesday'  , 'Wednesday',
    'Thursday' , 'Friday' , 'Saturday' ,
  ];
  const L = 7;
  let DayIndex = 0;
  switch (currentDay) {
    case 'Monday'    :  DayIndex = 1;  break;
    case 'Tuesday'   :  DayIndex = 2;  break;
    case 'Wednesday' :  DayIndex = 3;  break;
    case 'Thursday'  :  DayIndex = 4;  break;
    case 'Friday'    :  DayIndex = 5;  break;
    case 'Saturday'  :  DayIndex = 6;  break;
		default          :  throw new Error("Unrecognized weekday.");
  }
  const sum = DayIndex + days;
  const index = sum % L;
  return weekdays[index];
};
```

Examining this function, it should be apparent why the `%` operator in
programming languages is so useful. The `%` operator, in mathematical
terms, is the _natural number remainder operation_:

> **definition**. Where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are natural numbers, the operation:
>
> $$
> 	a \tmod b
> $$
>
> returns the remainder of ${\dfrac{a}{b}.}$

To truly under what this definition means, we delve briefly into Euclidean
division.

### Divisibility

Whenever we divide an integer ${a}$ by an integer ${b,}$ we have two
possible outcomes:

1. ${a}$ can be divided into ${b}$ evenly (no remainder exists).
2. ${a}$ cannot be divided into ${b}$ evenly (there exists a remainder).

In logic terms:

$$
	a \div b =
	\begin{cases}
		\exists \mm{rem} \\
		\nexists \mm{rem}
	\end{cases}
$$

where ${\mm{rem}}$ is a remainder. For example, 4 can be divided into 2
evenly. 120 can be divided into 40 evenly. 2, however, cannot be divided
into 3 evenly, nor can 3 be divided into 2 evenly.

#### Quotient

**Euclidean division** is a mathematical operation based on this idea.
First, we introduce two operations:

> **quotient**. Let ${a \in \ZZ}$ and ${b \in \ZZ^+.}$ Then:
>
> $$
> 	a \tt{div} b = \floor{\dfrac{a}{b}}
> $$

The quotient operation works as follows: First, suppose our friend Billy is
a track and field star competing in a special circular track race. The
track has a special property. It has numbered sections starting at 0 and
ending at some natural number ${b}$, the length of the track:

<CircularQueue
	data={["0", "1", "2", "3", "...", "b-1", "b"]}
	scale={60}
	iradius={55}
/>

The race is won by whoever crosses ${b}$ the most times. Unfortunately,
Billy has been running in other races and he's pretty tired. He tells us
that he only has enough energy to cover ${a}$ total segments. The quotient
tells us that, if Billy can run past ${a}$ segments, he can cross ${b}$ a
total of ${a \tt{div} b}$ times.

For example, suppose the track is ${3}$ segments long. If Billy only has
enough energy to cover ${5}$ segments, then we have ${a = 5}$ and
${b = 3.}$ Thus, starting at the segument numbered 0:

1. Bill passes segment1. He has enough energy for 4 more segments.
2. Billy passes segment2. He has enough energy for 3 more segments.
3. Billy passes ${b}$. He's crossed ${b}$ once. Now he only has enough
   energy for 2 more segments.
4. Billy segment0. Only 1 more segment.
5. Billy passes segment1. Bill collapses at segment2.

Billy only crossed ${b}$ once. The entire drama is expressed by writing:
${5 \tt{div} 3 = 1.}$

Let's be clear that this is _not_ division operation. This is the
_quotient_ operation. It is a different operation. In fact, it's so
different that the word "quotient" in this context is a verb. When we
compute the quotient of two integers ${a}$ and ${b,}$ we _quotientize_
${a}$ and ${b.}$ This is standard mathematical terminology in group theory.

To see why this verb is necessary, here is the definition of real number
division:

> **division**. Let ${a, b \in \RR,}$ where ${b \neq 0.}$ Then:
>
> $$
>   a \div b = a \cdot \dfrac{1}{b}
> $$

This is a very different definition from the previous. Real number division
is an operation that can take real number inputs ‚Äî that includes fractional
numbers like 2.138 and irrational numbers like ${\pi.}$ Quotient, however,
is an operation that can only take integer inputs. It does not work for
fractional numbers or irrational numbers. For example, compare the outputs
for the following functions:

<DataTable
	data={{
		f: [
			(x) => x / 2,
			(x) => Math.floor(x / 2),
			(x) => x / 3,
			(x) => Math.floor(x / 3),
		],
		fLabels: [
			"a(x) = x \\div 2",
			"f(x) = x~~\\text{div}~~2",
			"b(x) = x \\div 3",
			"g(x) = x~~\\text{div}~~3",
		],
		domain: [-11, 13],
		step: 1,
	}}
	latex={true}
/>

The functions ${a}$ and ${b}$ divide ${x}$ by a constant. The functions
${f}$ and ${g}$ quotientize ${x}$ by a constant.

Importantly, ${a}$ can be negative, but ${b}$ cannot. What does ${a}$ being
negative mean? Well, it just means that Billy runs backwards along the
track instead of forwards. When we write ${-5 \text{div} 3 = -2,}$ we're
saying, if Billy has enough energy to cover 5 segments running backwards
along the track, he completes ${-2}$ runs along the track:

1. Starts at segment0 (5 remaining).
2. Billy runs backwards, and crosses ${b}$. That's one cross.
3. Past segment2. (3 remaining).
4. Past segment1. (2 remaining).
5. Past segment0. (1 remaining).
6. Past ${b.}$ Billy's crossed ${b}$ twice. 0 remaining.
7. Billy collapses at segment1.

#### Remainder

The third operation we introduce is the _remainder_ operation:

> **remainder**. Let ${a \in \ZZ}$ and ${b \in \ZZ^+.}$ Then:
>
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
>   a~\tt{rem}~b &= a - b(a~\tt{div}~b) \\[1em]
>   &= a - b\paren{\floor{\dfrac{a}{b}}}
> \end{aligned}
> $$

Relying on our friend Billy once more, the remainder operation tells us
which segment Billy stops at. Recall that the segments are all labeled with
natural numbers. Thus, the remainder can never be negative. It's always
either 0 or a positive number ‚Äî a natural number.

A few words of caution. The remainder operator is also called the _modulo_
operator, with some textbooks opting to use the notation ${a \bmod b.}$
From personal experience, this is a very bad idea. As we'll see later, this
notation looks too similar to the modular arithmetic notation, and can very
easily lead to confusion. Accordingly, we will not use this notation, nor
will we call it the _modulo_ operator. It's the remainder operator, written
as ${a \tt{rem} b.}$

Next, many programming languages provide the ${\tt{rem}}$ operator as `%`.
That is, ${a \tmod b}$ is equivalent to ${a \tt{rem} b.}$ It is not,
however, equivalent. Some programming languages will compute
${a - b(\ceil{a/b})}$ rather than ${a - b(\floor{a/b})}$ when ${a < 0.}$
That is, they use the ceiling function for negatives. This is not inline
with the mathematical definition. Some languages even allow ${b \leq 0,}$
when again, such a definition does not make much sense from a mathematical
standpoint. For the ${\tt{rem}}$ operation, ${b}$ is always positive.

#### Euclidean Division

At this point, we can now introduction Euclidean division:

> **euclidean division.** Let ${a \in \ZZ}$ and ${b \in \ZZ^+.}$ Then there
> exists two unique integers, ${q \in \ZZ}$ and ${r \in \ZZ^+,}$ such that:
>
> $$
> 	a = bq + r~~~\text{and}~~~0 \leq r < b
> $$

This proposition is also called _the division algorithm_. What are the
numbers ${q}$ and ${r}$? Well, if we have an integer ${a}$ and positive
integer ${b,}$ ${q}$ and ${r}$ are given by:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		q &= a \tt{div} b \\
		r &= a \tt{rem} b
	\end{aligned}
$$

The Euclidean algorithm introduces us to the notion of divisibility.

#### Divisibility

Divisibility is defined as follows:

> **divisibility**. Let ${a,b \in \ZZ,}$ where ${b \neq 0.}$ If there exists
> a ${q \in \ZZ}$ such that ${a = bq,}$ then we say that ${b}$ _divides_ >
> ${a}$ and write:
>
> $$
> 	b \divs a
> $$
>
> Else, we say that ${b}$ does not divide ${a,}$ and write:
>
> $$
> 	b \nmid a
> $$

Casting this definition in Euclidean division terms:

> **lemma**. Let ${a,b \in \ZZ}$ and ${b \neq 0.}$ ${b}$ divides ${a}$ iff:
>
> $$
> 	a \tt{rem} |b| = 0
> $$

Note the use of the absolute value. Remember that the remainder operator is
defined only for ${b \in \ZZ^+.}$ Alternatively, we can also write:

> Let ${a,b \in \ZZ}$ and ${b \neq 0.}$ ${b}$ divides ${a}$ iff:
>
> $$
> 	\dfrac{a}{b} \in \ZZ
> $$

From the definition of divisibility, we have the notion of a _multiple_:

> **definition.** Let ${a,b \in \ZZ.}$ Then ${a}$ is a _multiple_ of ${b}$
> iff ${b \mid a.}$

As well as the notion of a factor:

> **definition.** Let ${a,b \in \ZZ.}$ Then ${b}$ is a _factor_ of ${b}$ iff
> ${b \mid a.}$

There are several useful properties of divisibility to keep in mind:

> **properties.** Let ${a, b, c \in \ZZ}$ where ${a \neq 0.}$ Then:
>
> 1.  If:
>     - ${(a \divs b)}$
>     - ${\implies}$ ${(a \divs bc)}$ for _any_ integer ${c.}$
> 2.  If:
>     - ${(a \divs b)}$ and
>     - ${(a \divs c)}$
>     - ${\implies}$ ${(a \divs b + c)}$
> 3.  If:
>     - ${(a \divs b)}$ and
>     - ${(b \divs c)}$
>     - ${\implies}$ ${(a \divs c).}$

### Modular Arithmetic

Now that we have the basic constructs of divisibility, we can now examine a
more formal treatment of modular arithmetic. First, we begin with a
definition:

> **definition.** Let ${a, b \in \ZZ}$ and ${m \in \ZZ^+.}$ If:
>
> $$
> 	m \divs (a - b)
> $$
>
> then ${a}$ is congruent to ${b}$ modulo ${m,}$ and we write:
>
> $$
> 	a \equiv b~(\bmod~m)
> $$

Put differently:

> Let ${a,b,m \in \ZZ}$ and ${0 < m.}$ If there exists a ${q \in Z}$ such
> that:
>
> $$
> 	a-b = mq
> $$
>
> then:
>
> $$
> 	a \equiv b~(\bmod~m)
> $$

Or, alternatively:

> Let ${a,b,m \in \ZZ}$ and ${0 < m.}$ Iff:
>
> $$
> 	\dfrac{a-b}{m} \in \ZZ
> $$
>
> then:
>
> $$
> 	a \equiv b~(\bmod~m)
> $$

For example, from the definition above, we know that
${9 \equiv 3~(\bmod~2)}$. Why? Because:

$$
	\dfrac{9-3}{2} = \dfrac{6}{2} = 3
$$

and ${3}$ is an integer.
