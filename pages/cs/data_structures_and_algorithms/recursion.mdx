# Recursion

_This chapter covers notes on recursion._

1. [Recursion Theorem](#recursion-theorem)
2. [Writing Recursive Functions](#writing-recursive-functions)

## Recursion Theorem
Recursion is a mathematical theorem implied by the construction of the natural numbers. Recall the theorem's statement:

> __recursion theorem.__ Let ${\Ss}$ be a set with ${x \in \Ss}$ and the injective function ${f : \Ss \inj \Ss.}$ Then there exists a function ${g : \nat \to X}$ such that
> 
> > (1) ${g(0) = x,}$ and
> >
> > (2) ${\forall n \in \nat [g(n + 1) = f(g(n))].}$

## Writing Recursive Functions
Many authors recommend treating recursive functions as definitions, and to stop thinking of them as procedures. _This is bad, bad advice_. The premise is, because recursion is a method of constructing definitions in mathematics, we should think of them as definitions rather than procedures. But the premise is fundamentally flawed, because procedure is precisely why recursive definitions are so useful â€” they tell us _what to do next_ to construct a particular object. Moreover, rigorous recursive definitions in mathematics rarely come from a simple "What is the base case?" followed by "What is ${x?}$" Look at any mathematician working on a rigorous definition, and you'll find piles of papers filled with trial-and-error calculations. We _always_ look at the recursive function as a procedure.
