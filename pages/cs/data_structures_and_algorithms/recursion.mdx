# Recursion

Many problems have some form of self-similarity or self-reference. Put
differently, the problem can be solved by using facts from a previous
attempt at the problem to make the problem smaller or simpler. Whenever we
encounter such problems, our best bet is to try **recursion**.

For recursion to work, we must define the "simpler" boundary — where the
problem can't get any simpler. This is called the **base case**. It follows
that before we reach the base case, we might have to go through many
versions of the problem. These are versions of the problem larger than the
base case, but smaller than the original problem. Some of these problem
versions are called **recursive cases** — versions of the problem that
allow us to get to a simpler case. Others are **non-recursive cases** —
versions of the problem where the road ends; we know there isn't a solution
and should stop trying.

For example, suppose we want to compute the sum of the first ${n}$
integers. Without using Gauss's formula, we can perform this computation
iteratively or recursively:

<Grid cols={2} colgap={2}>

```java
public int sum(int n) {
	int result = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
		result += i;
	}
	return result;
}
```

```java
public static int sum(int n) {
	if (n == 0) {
		return 0;
	} else {
		return n + sum(n-1);
	}
}
```

</Grid>

Let's see a few more examples.

## Recursive Exponentiation

Consider how we might compute:

$$
	a^b
$$

where ${b > 0.}$ We can solve this iteratively or recursively:

<Grid cols={2} colgap={2}>
```java
public static int pow(int base, int exp) {
	int result = 1;
	for (int i = 1; i <= exp; i++) {
		result *= base;
	}
	return result;
}
```

```java
public static int pow(int base, int exp) {
	if (exp == 0) {
		return 1;
	} else {
		return base * pow(base, exp-1);
	}
}
```

</Grid>

This is a good point to discuss recursion and stack memory.

## Recursive Factorial

Let's see another example, computing ${n!,}$ where ${n > 0.}$ To the left
is an iterative implementation, and to the right is a recursive
implementation:

<Grid cols={2} colgap={5}>

```cpp
int factorial(int n) {
	int result = 1;
	while (n > 1) {
		result *= n;
		n--;
	}
	return result;
}
```

```cpp
int factorial(int n) {
	if (n == 1) {
		return 1;
	} else {
		return n * factorial(n-1);
	}
}
```

</Grid>

## Types of Recursion

There are two broad types of recursion: (1) **tail recursion** and (2)
**head recursion**.

### Tail Recursion

A _tail recursive function_ is a recursive function where the recursive
call is at the end of the function. Tail recursive functions are similar to
loops — the function executes all of its statements before jumping to the
next recursive call. The `sum()` function shown previously is an example of
a tail-recursive function.

A rough outline of a tail recursive function in pseudocode:

```nasm
func(arg) {
	if (condition) return;
	// operations
	func(arg-1); // recursive call is last
}
```

### Head Recursion

A _head recursive function_ is a recursive function where the recursive
call occurs towards the beginning of the function rather than the last.
With head recursion, we have access to the state of the function call
before jumping into the next recursive call. This is helpful for some
problems, but it also means that we need more memory to store state. In
later sections, we'll see ways of mitigating this problem (e.g., through
_memoization_).

A rough outline of a head recursive function in pseudocode:

```nasm
func(arg) {
	if (condition) return;
	func(arg-1); // recursive call is not last
	// operations
}
```

### Costs of Recursion

While recursion is often suitable for certain problems, it has its costs.
For one, recursion works by calling multiple function calls. This is the
primary problem of head recursive functions. Because the recursive call
appears last, each recursive call stays on the call stack until the very
last call. This means that the call stack can grow extremely large,
resulting in a **stack overflow**. For example, recall the recursive
implementation of the factorial function we saw earlier:

```cpp
int factorial(int n) {
	if (n == 1) {
		return 1;
	} else {
		return n * factorial(n-1);
	}
}
```

Because the recursive call is the last call made, this is a head-recursive
implementation. We can refactor the function in tail-recursive form as
follows:

```cpp
int factorial(int n, int result) {
	if (n == 1) return result;
	return factorial(n-1, n*result);
}
```

Other than the changed style, how is this different from the previous
implementation? The key different is the else block's line. In the
head-recursive implementation, we wrote:

```cpp
return n * factorial(n-1);
```

In the tail-recursive implementation, we wrote:

```cpp
return factorial(n-1, n*result);
```

In the head-recursive implementation all previous calls to `factorial()`
must wait for its call to `factorial()` to return. Why? Because its
computation hasn't finished. It has to compute `n * <result of call>`, but
it doesn't have `<result of call>` yet. With the tail-recursive
implementation, there are no unknowns. If `n` isn't 1, we call `factorial`
with the current value of `n` minus 1, and the current value of `n` times
the current value of `result`. This means that the tail-recursive
`factorial` has all the information it needs to finish its operations and
return.

#### Backtracking

Head recursion is often associated with the phenomenon of **backtracking**.
To illustrate, consider the following code's output:

```cpp
void h(int n) {
	printf("h(n) called with n = %d\n", n);
	if (n == 0) {
		return;
	}
	h(n-1);
	printf("n = %d\n", n);
}

int main() {
	h(3);
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
h(n) called with n = 3
h(n) called with n = 2
h(n) called with n = 1
h(n) called with n = 0
n = 1
n = 2
n = 3
```

Let's walk through this code. When we first call `h(n)`, we have `n = 3`,
so, we create new call frame is created for `h(3)`.

<Mem
	data={["vdots1", { val: "n=3", a: "0x1000", id: "h(3)" }, "vdots1"]}
	scale={30}
/>

Then, we get to the base case (`n == 0`), and see that it's false. So, we
move to the next line, which is a call to `h(n-1)` — i.e., `h(2)`:

<Mem
	data={[
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "h(2)", a: "0x1004" },
		{ val: "n=3", a: "0x1000", id: "h(3)" },
		"vdots1",
	]}
	scale={30}
/>

This results in a new call frame for `h(2)`:

<Mem
	data={[
		{ val: "n=2", a: "0x1100", id: "h(2)" },
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "h(2)", a: "0x1004" },
		{ val: "n=3", a: "0x1000", id: "h(3)" },
		"vdots1",
	]}
	scale={40}
/>

Here, too, we see that the base case `n == 0` is false, so we create a new
call frame for `h(1)`:

<Mem
	data={[
		{ val: "n=1", a: "0x1100", id: "h(1)" },
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "h(1)", a: "0x1100" },
		{ val: "n=2", a: "0x1100", id: "h(2)" },
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "h(2)", a: "0x1004" },
		{ val: "n=3", a: "0x1000", id: "h(3)" },
		"vdots1",
	]}
	width={250}
	scale={60}
/>

Again we don't satisfy the base case condition, so we make a new call frame
for `h(0)`:

<Mem
	data={[
		{ val: "n=0", a: "0x1300", id: "h(0)" },
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "h(0)", a: "0x1200" },
		{ val: "n=1", a: "0x1200", id: "h(1)" },
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "h(1)", a: "0x1100" },
		{ val: "n=2", a: "0x1100", id: "h(2)" },
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "h(2)", a: "0x1004" },
		{ val: "n=3", a: "0x1000", id: "h(3)" },
		"vdots1",
	]}
	width={250}
	scale={60}
/>

At this call, we satisfy the base case, so we `return`. At the frame
`h(0)`, none of the instructions after the `return` statement are executed.
So, the `h(0)` frame disappears:

<Mem
	data={[
		{ val: "n=1", a: "0x1200", id: "h(1)" },
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "h(1)", a: "0x1100" },
		{ val: "n=2", a: "0x1100", id: "h(2)" },
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "h(2)", a: "0x1004" },
		{ val: "n=3", a: "0x1000", id: "h(3)" },
		"vdots1",
	]}
	width={250}
	scale={60}
/>

Now `h(1)` can execute the instruction after `h(n-1)`, which is to print
the value of `n`:

<Mem
	data={[
		{ val: "n=1", a: "0x1200", id: "print 'n = 1'" },
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "h(1)", a: "0x1100" },
		{ val: "n=2", a: "0x1100", id: "h(2)" },
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "h(2)", a: "0x1004" },
		{ val: "n=3", a: "0x1000", id: "h(3)" },
		"vdots1",
	]}
	width={250}
	scale={60}
/>

`h(1)`'s call frame disappears, and we get back to `h(2)`. Since `h(n-1)`
has finished executing, we go to the next line: Print the value of `n`:

<Mem
	data={[
		{ val: "n=2", a: "0x1100", id: "print 'n = 2'" },
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "h(2)", a: "0x1004" },
		{ val: "n=3", a: "0x1000", id: "h(3)" },
		"vdots1",
	]}
	width={250}
	scale={60}
/>

Once that's done, `h(2)` disappears, and we're back in `h(3)`'s call frame.
`h(n-1)` has finished, so we print the value of `n`:

<Mem
	data={[{ val: "n=3", a: "0x1000", id: "print 'n = 3'" }, "vdots1"]}
	width={250}
	scale={60}
/>

And once that's done, `h(n)` has finally finished executing. Notice,
however the call pattern:

```nasm
h(3)
	h(2)
		h(1)
			h(0)
		print n=1
	print n=2
printn=3
```

We go all the way down to `n = 0`, then _work our way back_ through the
call frames. This is the notion of _backtracking_; we are _backtracking_
through our previous work.
