## Basic Definitions
### Functions
> __~definition: function~.__ A _function_ is an assignment from a set ${A}$ to a set ${B,}$ such that each element of ${A}$ is mapped to a unique element of ${B.}$

### Recursion Theorem
> __~recursion theorem~.__ Let ${\Ss}$ be a set with ${x \in \Ss}$ and the injective function ${f : \Ss \inj \Ss.}$ Then there exists a function ${g : \nat \to X}$ such that
>  
> 1. ${g(0) = x,}$ and
> 2. ${\forall n \in \nat [g(n + 1) = f(g(n))].}$

### Language
> __~definition: token~.__ A _token_ is any symbol that may be processed by a machine.

> __~definition: alphabet~.__ An _alphabet_ is a finite set of tokens.

> __~definition: natural sequence~.__ For ${n \in \nat,}$ the notation ${\ix{n}}$ denotes the well-ordered set ${\set{k \in \nat}: 1 \le k \le n,}$ with ${\ix{0} = \nil.}$ We call each number in the natural sequence an _index_.

> __~definition: word~.__ Let ${k}$ be an index, and let ${x}$ be a token in some alphabet ${\Aa}$ without the token ${\lq \epsilon. \rq}$  A _word_ is a map ${w : \ix{n} \to \Aa : k \mapsto w(k),}$ where ${k \in \ix{n}.}$ That is, ${w}$ is any set of ordered pairs ${(k,x)}$ such that, if ${(k,x) \in w}$ and ${(k,x') \in w,}$ then ${x = x'.}$ We denote the token at index ${k}$ with the notation ${w(k) = x,}$ the empty bitstring with the symbol ${\epsilon,}$ and we the number ${n}$ the _length_ of the word ${w.}$

> __~definition: language~.__ A _language_ is a set of words ${\Ll \subseteq \Sigma^*,}$ where ${\Sigma}$ is an alphabet and ${\Sigma^*}$ is the set of all strings over ${\Sigma.}$

> __~definition: context-free grammar~.__ A _context-free grammar_ is a quadruple ${\Gg = (\Aa,\Vv,\Ww,s),}$ where ${\Aa}$ is an alphabet whose tokens are called _terminals_, ${\Vv}$ is a finite set of tokens called _variables_ with ${\Aa \cap \Vv = \nil,}$ ${\Ww}$ is a set of equivalence classes of words over ${\Aa \dup \Vv,}$ and ${s \in \Vv}$ is a start variable. We call a word of terminals or nonterminals on ${\Gg}$ a _sentence_.

### Lambda Calculus
#### Abstraction
> __~definition~.__ An _abstraction_ is a pair ${\px{\lambda x,e_x},}$ where ${\lambda x}$ is called the _head_ of the abstraction, and ${e_x}$ is a word with ${x}$ called the _body_ of the abstraction. We denote an abstraction with the notation ${\lambda x \mc e_x,}$ where ${\lambda}$ demarcates the beginning of the head, and ${\mc}$ demarcates the beginning of the body. Given the head ${\lambda x,}$ ${x}$ is a called a _parameter_. The value mapped to the parameter is called an _argument_. Given the body ${x,}$ if ${x}$ contains a symbol contained in its head, we call such a symbol a _bound variable_. If ${x}$ contains a symbol not contained in the head, we call the symbol a _free variable_.

~remark~. All abstractions are functions, but not all functions are abstractions. First, abstractions have no names. E.g., when we write ${f(x) = x^2,}$ the function's name is ${f.}$ As an abstraction: ${\lambda x \mc x^2.}$ Because of this property, we may also call abstractions _anonymous functions_. Second, abstractions take _only one argument_. In mathematics, we have functions such as ${f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2.}$ For now, we will say that this is not permitted.

~example~. ${\lambda x \mc x}$ is an abstraction with one bound variable, ${x.}$

~example~. ${\lambda x \mc xy}$ is an abstraction with one bound variable ${x}$ and one free variable ${y.}$

#### Beta Reduction
> __~definition~.__ Let ${\px{\lambda x \mc e_x} \px{v}}$ be an abstraction. Let ${v}$ be input fed to the head. The _beta reduction_ of ${\lambda x \mc e_x}$ is defined as follows.
> 
> 1. Examine the body ${e_x,}$ reading from left to right.
> 2. If a bound variable ${x}$ is encountered, replace ${x}$ with the argument ${v.}$
> 3. If a free variable is encountered, continue.
> 3. After the last bound ${x}$ has been replaced, return ${b.}$

~example~. ${\px{\lambda x \mc x} \px{2} = 2.}$

~example~. ${\px{\lambda n \mc n + 2} \px{8} = 8 + 2.}$

~example~. ${\px{\lambda a \mc a} \px{\lambda b \mc b} = \lambda b \mc b.}$

~example~. From the definition, beta-reduction is left-associative.

$$
\eqs{
\px{\lambda x \mc x}\px{\lambda y \mc y}z
&= \px{\lambda y \mc y} z &\dk \color{grey}{x := \lambda y \mc y} \\
&= z &\dk \color{grey}{y := z}
}
$$

~example~. ${\px{\lambda x \mc x y}z = zy.}$ We cannot replace ${y}$ because it is a free variable.

### Currying
> __~notation~.__ The expression ${\lambda xy \mc xy}$ is shorthand for the abstraction ${\lambda x \mc \px{\lambda y \mc xy}.}$

~example~.

$$
\eqs{
	\px{\lambda xy \mc xy} \px{1,2}
	&= \px{\lambda x \mc \px{\lambda y \mc x y}} \px{1,2} \\
	&= \px{\out{\lambda x} \mc \px{\lambda y \mc \out{x}^1 y}} \px{\out{1},2} \\
	&= \px{\lambda y \mc 1 y} \px{2} \\
	&= \px{\out{\lambda y} \mc 1 \out{y}^2} \px{2} \\
	&= 1 \dk 2 \\
}
$$

~example~.

$$
\eqs{
	\px{\lambda xy \mc xy}\px{\lambda z \mc a} \px{1}
	&= \px{\lambda x \px{\lambda y \mc xy}}\px{\lambda z \mc a} \px{1} \\
	&= \px{\out{\lambda x} \px{\lambda y \mc \tnote{\out{x}}{$\px{\lambda z \mc a}$}y}}\out{\px{\lambda z \mc a}} \px{1} \\
	&= \px{\lambda y \mc \px{\lambda z \mc a}y} \px{1} \\
	&= \px{\out{\lambda y} \mc \px{\lambda z \mc a}\out{y}^1} \out{\px{1}} \\
	&= \px{\lambda z \mc a} \dk 1 \\
	&= a
}
$$

~example~. _Currying_ is the process of decomposing a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that take only one argument.

$$
	f\px{x,y} \mapsto x^2 + y^2
	\dk
	\xRightarrow{curry}
	\dk
	f\px{x} \mapsto f\px{y} \mapsto x^2 + y^2
$$

~application~. Why might we want to use currying from an applied perspective? Two reasons: (1) It allows us to write much more generic procedures, and (2) it provides caching. For reason (1):

<Algo>

1. __function__ ${f\px{x}}$
	1. __return__ ${\px{y} \mapsto (x \rem y = 0)}$

</Algo>

The function ${f}$ is essentially a _function factory_ â€” it produces functions whose body is of the form ${x \rem y = 0.}$ Thus, we can mass produce functions of this form with ease:

<Algo>

1. __function__ ${multipleof2 := f(2)}$
2. ${multipleof2\px{18}}$ _true_
3. ${multipleof2\px{19}}$ _false_
4. __function__ ${multipleof3 := f(3)}$
5. ${multipleof3\px{21}}$ _true_
6. __function__ ${multipleof4 := f(4)}$
7. ${multipleof4\px{19}}$ _false_

</Algo>

For reason (2):

<Algo>

1. __function__ ${expensiveComputation\px{x}}$
	1. ${\let{z}{expensiveOps}\px{x}}$
	2. __return__ ${\px{y} \mapsto z + y}$

</Algo>

When we write ${f = expensiveComputation\px{v},}$ we perform the expensive computation ${v}$ immediately. This effectively caches the result, reducing the cost of performing the operation elsewhere.

### Type System
> __~definition: type-system~.__ A _type-system_ is the collection of all the possible domains and codomains of functions under discussion. If a function's domain and codomain is not within the type-system, then the function is considered _undefined_. We call each set in the type-system a _type_.


### Atoms
> __~definition: atom~.__ An _atom_ is an element of a type that cannot be further simplified.

## Lists
> __~definition~.__ A _list_ is a sequence of objects ${(x_1, \ldots, x_n).}$ There exists a list of no objects, called the _empty list_, denoted ${\nil.}$ We call ${x_1}$ the _head_ of the list, and ${x_n}$ the _tail_ of the list.

~example~. ${(1,2,3,4)}$ is a list of integers.

~example~. ${\string{hello}}$ is a list of symbols. We call this particular list a _string_.

### Operations on Lists
Below are basic operations on lists.


## Orders of Functions
> __~definition: first-order function~.__ A _first-order function_ is a function that maps primitive data values to primitive data values. That is, a function that takes atoms as arguments and returns atoms as values.

> __~definition: higher-order function~.__ A _higher-order function_ is a function that maps functions to either functions or atoms. I.e., a function that takes functions as arguments and returns either functions or atoms as values.

~example~. Differentiation is a function that takes a function and returns a function.

~example~. Indefinite integration is a function that takes a function and returns a function.

~example~. Definite integration is a function that takes a function and returns an atom (some number).
