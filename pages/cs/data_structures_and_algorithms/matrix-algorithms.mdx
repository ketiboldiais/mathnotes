## Vectors
> __~definition~.__ A _vector_ is a tuple ${\ix{a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}},}$ where ${n}$ is the _length_ of the vector, corresponding to the number of elements comprised by the tuple. We call such elements ${a_i}$ the _components_ of the vector, where each ${i \in \nat, 0 \lt i \le n}$ is the component's respective _index_. The set of all indices ${i}$ is called the vector's _dimensions_. We denote a vector with Latin or Greek letters, crowned with a ray (e.g., ${\vc{v}}$). Given a vector ${\vc{v},}$ we denote the ${\ith{i}}$ component with ${v\ix{i},}$ and the _length_ of ${\vc{v}}$ with ${\len{(v)}.}$

> __~definition~.__ The _zero-vector_ is a vector ${v}$ such that, for all ${i \lt \len{(v)},}$ it follows that ${v\ix{i}=0.}$ We denote the zero vector with ${\vc{0}.}$

### Applications of Vectors
__~2d-coordinates~.__ Given a two-dimensional geometry ${S,}$ a vector ${\ix{x,y}}$ denotes a location in ${S.}$

__~3d-coordinates~.__ Given a three-dimensional geometry ${S,}$ a vector ${\ix{x,y,z}}$ denotes a location in ${S.}$

__~exam data~.__ A person's exam data may be represented as a vector ${\ix{\tx{id},\tx{verbal},\tx{written},\tx{numeric}}.}$

__~time series data~.__ A vector may represent a stock's price ${p_i}$ over a given interval of time: ${\ix{125.2, 134.5, 133.6, \ldots, p_n}.}$

### Vector Implementations
Unless otherwise stated, we use dynamic arrays as implementations of vectors. For some algorithms, we may use linked lists. We will always make deviations from dynamic arrays explicit.

### Vector Operations
#### Scalar Multiplication 
<Algo>

__~scalar multiplication~.__ Let ${\vc{v}}$ be a vector of length ${n,}$ and let ${c}$ be a number. Then the operation ${c \by \vc{v},}$ called _scalar multiplication_, is defined by the procedure below. Per the procedure, ${c \by \vc{v}}$ is a _commutative operation_.

- __Argument__: ${\vc{v},}$ a vector, and ${c,}$ a constant.
- __Image__: ${\df{vector}.}$

1. __define__ ${\df{number} \by \df{vector} ~:=~ \df{scalar-multiplication}(\df{number},\df{vector})}$
2. __define__ ${\df{vector} \by \df{number} ~:=~ \df{scalar-multiplication}(\df{number},\df{vector})}$
3. __function__ ${\df{scalar-multiplication}(c,\vc{v})}$
	1. __for__ ${\let{i}{0},~i \lt \len{(\vc{v})},~i\texttt{++}}$
		1. ${\let{\vc{v}\ix{i}}{\vc{v}\ix{i} \times c}}$
	2. __return__ ${\vc{v}}$

</Algo>

~example~. ${4 \by \ix{1,2,3} = \ix{4,8,12}.}$

~example~. ${4 \by \ix{~} = \ix{~}.}$

#### Vector Addition 
<Algo>

__~vector addition~.__ Let ${\vc{v}}$ be a vector of length ${n}$ and let ${\vc{w}}$ be a vector of length ${n.}$ Then the operation ${\vc{v} + \vc{w},}$ called _vector addition_, is defined by the procedure below.

- __Argument__: ${\vc{v},}$ a vector, and ${\vc{w},}$ a vector.
- __Image__: ${\df{vector}}$
- __Ensure__: ${\len{(\vc{v})} = \len{(\vc{w})}}$

1. __define__ ${(\df{vector}) + (\df{vector}) := \df{vector-addition}(\df{vector},\df{vector})}$
1. __function__ ${\df{vector-addition}(\vc{v},\vc{w})}$
	1. __if__ ${\len{(\vc{v})} = \len{(\vc{w})}}$ __then__
		1. __for__ ${\let{i}{0},~ i \lt \len{(\vc{v})},~ i\pl\pl}$
			1. ${\let{\vc{v}\ix{i}}{\pl \vc{w}\ix{i}}}$
		2. __return__ ${\vc{v}}$

</Algo>

_Remark._ Vector addition is only defined on vectors of the same length. It is undefined for vectors of unequal length.

## Mazes
Consider the following matrix.

|     | 0       | 1       | 2       | 3       | 4       |
| --- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 0   | ${\wc}$ | ${\wc}$ | ${\wc}$ | ${\wc}$ | ${\wc}$ |
| 1   | ${\wc}$ | ${\bs}$ | ${\wc}$ | ${\wc}$ | ${\wc}$ |
| 2   | ${\wc}$ | ${\bs}$ | ${\bs}$ | ${\wc}$ | ${\wc}$ |
| 3   | ${\wc}$ | ${\bs}$ | ${\ws}$ | ${\wc}$ | ${\wc}$ |
| 4   | ${\wc}$ | ${\bs}$ | ${\bs}$ | ${\wc}$ | ${\wc}$ |
| 5   | ${\ws}$ | ${\wc}$ | ${\wc}$ | ${\wc}$ | ${\wc}$ |

Each black square corresponds to a wall, each white dot corresponds to open space, and each white square corresponds to an exit. Mathematically, this is a matrix where each cell can only be occupied by exactly one of three values: ${0}$ (a wall), ${1}$ (open space), or ${-1}$ (an exit). We call such a matrix a _maze_.

> __~definition: maze~.__ Let ${M}$ be an ${R \times C}$ matrix, where ${R \in \pint}$ is the number of columns, and ${C \in \pint}$ is the number of rows. We say that ${M}$ is a maze if, and only if, given any cell ${c_{ij},}$ it follows that ${c_{ij} \in \uint}$ and ${-1 \le c_{ij} \le 1,}$ for all ${0 \le i \lt R}$ and for all ${0 \le j \lt C.}$

~example~. The previous matrix can be visualized as:

|     | 0      | 1     | 2      | 3     | 4     |
| --- | ------ | ----- | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| 0   | ${1}$  | ${1}$ | ${1}$  | ${1}$ | ${1}$ |
| 1   | ${1}$  | ${0}$ | ${1}$  | ${1}$ | ${1}$ |
| 2   | ${1}$  | ${0}$ | ${0}$  | ${1}$ | ${1}$ |
| 3   | ${1}$  | ${0}$ | ${-1}$ | ${1}$ | ${1}$ |
| 4   | ${1}$  | ${0}$ | ${0}$  | ${1}$ | ${1}$ |
| 5   | ${-1}$ | ${1}$ | ${1}$  | ${1}$ | ${1}$ |

Associated with mazes is the operation of navigation.

> __~definition: navigation~.__ Let ${M}$ be an ${R \times C}$ maze. Given: a pair ${(r,c)}$ where ${0 \le r \lt R}$ and ${0 \le c \lt C,}$ and one element of ${\set{y^+, y^-, x^+, x^-},}$ the operation ${\df{nav}}$ is defined as follows:
> 
> $$
> 	\df{nav}((r,c), d) \case{
> 		(r+1,c) &\if d = y^+ \\
> 		(r-1,c) &\if d = y^- \\
> 		(r,c+1) &\if d = x^+ \\
> 		(r,c-1) &\if d = x^- \\
> 	}
> $$







## Shortest Path: Maze
Given a maze ${M_{RC}}$ we often want to find the shortest possible path from a
given coordinate ${(r,c) \in RC}$ to an exit ${[(a,b)=0] \in RC.}$ This is
merely a variant of the shortest path problem on adjacency matrices. The number
of possible paths depends on where we first start (the pair ${(r,c)}$). For
example, using the example matrix from the previous section, suppose we're
initially placed at ${(1,2).}$ There are several possible paths to an exit.

Our task is to find the shortest path. The best approach here is to use a
breadth-first traversal. We start at our starting point ${(r,c),}$ and explore
outwards, rather than inwards. The moment we encounter an exit, we return the
length of the path. Otherwise, we continue exploring. The algorithm below is
one possible implementation.

	1. ${\let{R}{\len{M}}}$ _number of rows_
	2. ${\let{C}{\len{M\ix{0}}}}$ _number of columns_
	3. ${\let{queue}{\df{new queue}}}$
	4. ${\let{queue}{\df{enqueue}(\ix{r,c,0})}}$ _triple ${(\tx{row index}, \tx{col index}, \tx{distance})}$_

	6. ${\let{visited}{\df{insert}}(\ix{r,c})}$
	7. ${\let{\Delta}{\set{{\ix{1,0}, \ix{\mi 1,0}, \ix{0,1}, \ix{0,\mi 1}}}}}$  _all possible turns_

The initial state. For readability, we're using shapes rather than numbers. Let
${\bs = 0,}$ ${\wc = 1,}$ and ${\bigstar = -1.}$ Our starting position will be
${(0,2).}$ We mark our initial position and our current positions thereafter
with the letter ${p,}$ and mark visited cells with black dots. We have two
auxiliary structures, ${queue}$ corresponding to a queue, and ${visited,}$
corresponding to a set. Both have been initialized, corresponding to lines 1
through 6 in the pseudocode.

The queue is not empty, so we enter the while-loop. We dequeue ${queue,}$ and get back the triple ${\ix{0,2,0}.}$ Following lines 10 through 13, we have:

| ${row}$ | ${col}$ | ${\varepsilon}$ |
| ------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 0       | 2       | 0               |

The element ${M\ix{0}\ix{2} \neq -1,}$ so we enter the for-loop. For each of
the possible moves (stored in the set ${\Delta}$), we compute the row-neighbor
(${\Nn_{row}}$) and column-neighbor (${\Nn_{col}}$). This yields the table
below. The last two rows indicate the pairs inserted into visited and the pairs
that will be dequeued respectively (those that satisfy conditions from lines 17
to 21). Notice the queuers are triples of the form ${(r_n, c_n, \delta),}$
where ${r_n}$ is the row-index of a neighbor, ${c_n}$ is the column-index of a
neighbor, and ${\delta}$ is the distance, incremented by 1. That third
component (the distance) is the key to this problem. By having every queuer
maintain the current distance travelled from the starting place, the shortest path
will be held by the queuer who reaches an exit first. We've crossed out all the neighbor
coordinates that fail the conditions for inserting into the ${visited}$ set and enqueueing.

The queue is not empty, so we enter the while-loop. We dequeue ${queue,}$ and
get back the triple ${\ix{2,1,3}.}$ So, we will place ${p}$ at the coordinate
${\ix{2,1}.}$

calculate the neighbor indices, this time with ${\ix{r,c}=\ix{2,1}.}$

We will end the trace here. Notice that ${\ix{2,0,4}}$ is now in the queue. The pair ${\ix{2,0}}$ will return the element ${M\ix{2}\ix{0}=-1,}$
which corresponds to an exit. The returned length is ${4,}$ which is correct — the shortest path to an exit starting at ${\ix{0,2}}$ is, in fact,
a path of length 4.

## Minimum Bridge
Consider the following matrix ${A,}$ comprised of two islands:

$$
	A=\mx{
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
		1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
		1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
	}
$$

An island is defined as a 1 whose vertical or horizontal neighbors are 1s. We call the number of cells to change to a 1, such that the number of islands of ${M}$ is exactly 1, a _bridge_. A _minimum bridge_, denoted ${\df{minb}(M),}$ is defined as the ${\min\set{B},}$ where ${B}$ is the set of all possible bridges. Given a matrix ${M}$ of exactly 2 islands, is there an algorithm that returns ${\df{minb}(M)?}$ In the case of ${A,}$ we have ${\df{minb}(A) = 1.}$


$$
	A=\mx{
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
		1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
		1 & 1 & 1 & {\red 1} & 1 \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
	}
$$

This problem resolves to a shortest-path problem. We start by searching for our first island. Once encountered, we then perform a bread-first search for another island, keeping track of our distance from our starting island. As soon as we encounter our second island, we return the distance tracked. Importantly, it doesn't matter which island we start on, since ${M}$ will always comprise of two islands. Below is an illustration of the exploration sequence. We start at any location of the island, and continue exploring outwards. The numbers in each cell correspond to the distance travelled.

$$
	\ax{
		\wd{{1}}\yd{{0}}\wd{{1}}\wd{{2}}\wd{{3}}\sd{\no{1}}\\
		\yd{{0}}\yd{{0}}\wd{{1}}\wd{{2}}\wd{{3}}\sd{\no{1}}\\
		\wd{{1}}\yd{{0}}\wd{{1}}\wd{{2}}\wd{{3}}\sd{\no{1}}\\
		\wd{{2}}\wd{{1}}\wd{{2}}\wd{{3}}\sd{\no{1}}\sd{\no{1}}\\
		\wd{{3}}\wd{{2}}\wd{{3}}\yd{\no{1}}\yd{\no{1}}\sd{\no{1}}\\
		\sd{\no{1}}\sd{\no{1}}\sd{\no{1}}\sd{\no{1}}\sd{\no{1}}\sd{\no{1}}
	}
