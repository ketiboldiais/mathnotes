## Scheduling Theory
Graph theory plays a significant role in _scheduling theory_.

> __~definition: task.~__ A _task_ is a quadruple ${T=(O,t,\Delta T,\omega T),}$ where ${O}$ is an operation, ${t}$ is an interval ${\ix{\df{start}(T), \df{end}(T)} \subset \pint,}$ and ${w}$ is a positive integer. We call the integer ${\df{start}(T)}$ the _start_ of ${T,}$ the integer ${\df{end}(T)}$ the _completion_ of ${T,}$ the integer ${\Delta T = \df{end}(T) - \df{start}(T)}$ the _processing time_ of ${T,}$ and ${\omega T}$ the _weight_ of ${T.}$

> __~definition: job~.__ A job is a set of ${n}$ tasks: ${\Jj = \set{T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_n}.}$ Unless otherwise specified, ${\abs{\Jj} = n,}$ and for each task ${T_i \in \Jj,}$ it follows that ${\omega T_i = 1.}$ Given a set of ${n}$ jobs ${\Jj,}$ we denote the _processing time_ of ${\Jj}$ as ${\Delta \Jj,}$ defined as:

$$
	\Delta \Jj = \dsum{i=1}{n} \Delta T_i = \Delta T_1 + \Delta T_2 + \ldots + \Delta T_n.
$$

> __~definition: sequential job~.__ A _sequential job_ is a sequence of ${n}$ tasks ${\Jj = (T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_n),}$ such that the first task ${T_1}$ is completed first, the last task ${T_n}$ is completed last, and for each ${T_{1 \lt i \lt n}}$ in ${\Jj,}$ the task ${T_{i-1}}$ is completed before the task ${T_i.}$ We define ${\df{start}(\Jj)=\df{start}(T_1),}$ and ${\df{end}(\Jj)=\df{end}(T_n).}$

> __~definition: timed job~.__ A _timed job_ is a sequential job such that ${\df{start}(\Jj) = a}$ and ${\df{end}(\Jj) = b}$ where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are constant positive integers with ${a \lt b.}$ We call the integer ${a}$ the _commencement_ of ${\Jj,}$ and the integer ${b}$ the _deadline_ of ${\Jj.}$

> __~definition: weighted job~.__ A _weighted job_ is a sequential job such that, for any two tasks ${T_a}$ and ${T_b,}$ it follows that either ${\omega T_a \neq \omega T_b,}$ ${\df{start}(T_a) \lt \df{start}(T_b),}$ or ${\df{start}(T_b) \lt \df{start}(T_a).}$ If ${\df{start}(T_a) = \df{start}(T_b),}$ then ${T_a}$ is completed before ${T_b}$ iff ${\omega T_a \lt \omega T_b,}$ and ${T_b}$ is completed before ${T_a}$ iff ${\omega T_b \lt \omega T_a.}$

> __~definition: schedule~.__ A _schedule_ is a mapping ${S:\Mm \to \Jj,}$ where ${\Jj}$ is a job or sequential job, and ${\Mm}$ is a set of objects that will perform the jobs.

## Critical Path
> __~definition: critical path~.__ Given a graph ${G}$ with vertices ${v}$ and ${w,}$ we call the longest path from ${v}$ to ${w}$ the _critical path_ from ${v}$ to ${w.}$

Examining the definition of _critical path_, we can likely see where graph theory plays a critical role. Consider the following graph of a project:


<Graph data={[
	{link: [{id:'start',dx:-23},'a'], class: 'red'},
	{link: ['a',{id:'end', dx:-22}]},
	{link: ['start',{id:'b', dy: -15}]},
	{link: ['b','end']},
	{link: ['a','d'], class: 'red'},
	{link: ['d','end'], class: 'red'},
]}
collisionRadius={10}
edgeLength={40}
straightEdges={true}
isDirected={true}
width={400}
height={100}
/>

Each of the vertices is a job, and each edge denotes the performance of that job. If we assume that each edge counts as 1 month, the longest path (the path comprising the red edges), tells us that the minimum amount of time needed to complete the project is 3 months (the 3 red edges). This is an enormously valuable piece of information when we consider just how complex projects can get â€” one where there are potentially thousands of jobs depending on the completion of thousands of others.


### Longest Path Algorithm on Adjacency Lists
Suppose we're given the directed acyclic graph below, represented by an adjacency list. The notion of a longest path only exists in the context of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs); otherwise, we could generate the longest path by simply traversing edges in an infinite loop.

<Grid cols={2}>
$$
	G \gets \lset{\ax{
		a &\mapsto& \ix{b} \\
		b &\mapsto& \ix{~} \\
		c &\mapsto& \ix{e} \\
		d &\mapsto& \ix{c,e} \\
		e &\mapsto& \ix{~} \\
		f &\mapsto& \ix{g} \\
		g &\mapsto& \ix{c}
	}}
$$
<Graph data={[
	{link:['a',{id:'b',class:'red'}]},
	{link:['c',{id:'e',class:'red'}],class:'red'},
	{link:['d','c']},
	{link:['d','e']},
	{link:['f','g'],class:'red'},
	{link:['g','c'],class:'red'},
]}
straightEdges={true}
isDirected={true}
height={120}
width={250}
fontSize={0.5}
tx={-15}
id={'longpath1'}
/>
</Grid>

We've marked the longest path with red edges. Because DAGs are directed and acyclic, they will always have at least one _sink_. That is, a vertex with no outgoing edges. For the example graph above, the two sinks are ${b}$ and ${e.}$ With adjacency lists, sinks are easily-identified: They're the hashmap keys whose values are empty arrays. Because DAGs always have at least one sink, we rely on this fact as a base case.

The general idea: We mark all the sinks first. Then, we traverse the entire graph ${G.}$ For each vertex we visit, we assign a ${\d \in \nat,}$ corresponding to how far the vertex is from a terminal vertex. This is done by successively incrementing the ${\d}$ value of the neighboring vertex furthest from the sink.


<Graph data={[
	{link:[{id:'a \\to 1',dy:-15},{id:'b \\to 0',class:'red',dx:10}]},
	{link:[{id:'c\\to 1',dx:10},{id:'e\\to 0',class:'red',dx:10}],class:'red'},
	{link:[{id:'d\\to 2'},'c\\to 1']},
	{link:['d\\to 2','e\\to 0']},
	{link:[{id:'f \\to 3',dy:5},{id:'g\\to 2',dx:9,dy:1}],class:'red'},
	{link:['g\\to 2','c\\to 1'],class:'red'},
]}
straightEdges={true}
isDirected={true}
height={120}
width={500}
fontSize={0.5}
tx={-15}
id={'longpath2'}
/>

The longest path, then, is the maximum ${\d}$ assigned. A special case is the vertex ${d,}$ which has two outgoing edges, ${d-e}$ and ${d-c.}$ The edge ${d-e}$ is a straight path from a source to a sink, so that cannot be the longest path. On the other hand, ${d-c}$ is a path from a source to a juncture (a vertex that is neither source nor sink). When determining the longest path, we want to return the length of the path towards a juncture whenever possible. Accordingly, we increment the neighbor distance of ${c,}$ which yields 2, and assign 2 to ${d.}$

	5. __for each__ ${V \in G}$ __do__

	7. __return__ ${P_{\max}}$

</Algo>

## Concurrent Tour Problem
Suppose we're given a graph, represented with an edge list. Each each vertex ${v}$ corresponds to the states of some procedure, and each edge ${(a,b)}$ corresponds to the relation: ${a}$ must be visited before ${b}$ is visited. We call ${a}$ a _prerequisite_ of ${b.}$ Suppose further that each vertex takes 1 unit of time to complete, and that multiple vertices may be visited simultaneously, so long as their prerequisites, if any, have been visited. Let ${T}$ denote the sum of all units of time to visit every vertex. The problem: Construct an algorithm that returns ${\min{T}.}$ That is, the minimum ${T}$ needed to visit every vertex under assumption.

As it turns out, the minimum ${T}$ necessary to visit every vertex is the _order of the longest path_. That is, the number of vertices comprising the longest path.
