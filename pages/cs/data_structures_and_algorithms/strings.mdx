In today's world, there's no such thing as a "string." There are _ASCII strings_ and _Unicode strings_. While we can classify them as a single type "string," that classification isn't very useful — they're different enough that we must treat them separately. Accordingly, whenever we work with "strings," we must always — always — ask: Are working with ASCII strings or Unicode string?

## Definitions

<dfn>

__alphabet.__ A non-empty set of _symbols_ is called an _alphabet_, denoted ${\Sigma.}$

</dfn>

For example, the set ${\set{0,1}}$ is an alphabet of two symbols. The set ${\set{a,b,c,d}}$ is an alphabet of four symbols.

<dfn>

__string.__ Given an alphabet ${\Sigma,}$ the finite sequence

$$
	{\omega} = \omega_i
	= \ar{{\omega}_0~~~{\omega}_1~~~{\omega}_2~~~\ldots~~~{\omega}_{n-1}}
$$

with ${\omega_i \in \Sigma}$ and ${n \in \nat}$ is called a _string_ over ${\Sigma}$ of _length_ ${n.}$ Given a symbol ${\omega_i,}$ we say that ${\omega_0}$ is the first symbol, and ${\omega_{n-1}}$ is the last symbol. We may denote the character o  We denote the length ${n}$ of ${\omega}$ as ${\len(\omega).}$ If ${\len(\omega)=0,}$ then we call the ${\omega}$ the _empty string_, and denote it ${\epsilon.}$

</dfn>

Note that we will denote strings with double quotes. Thus, the string _cookie_ is denoted ${{cookie}.}$ The string ${2 \pi r}$ is denoted ${{2 \pi r}.}$ Additionally, the empty string may also be denoted with the Greek letter ${\lambda.}$

Because how small subscripts are, we will adopt a few conventions when working with strings. First, given a string ${S,}$ we will reference the first character with ${S \ix{i},}$ where ${i}$ is an index. For example, given the string _cake_, writing ${{cake}\ix{0}}$ returns the string ${{c},}$ and writing ${{cake}\ix{2}}$ returns the string ${{k}.}$

<dfn>

__kleene closure.__ Given an alphabet ${\Sigma,}$ the set of all strings over ${\Sigma}$ is called the _Kleene closure_ of ${\Sigma,}$ denoted ${\Sigma^*.}$ 

</dfn>

<dfn>

__language.__ Given a Kleene closure ${\Sigma^*}$ and a set of strings ${\cal{L},}$ if ${\cal{L} \subseteq \Sigma^*,}$ then ${\cal{L}}$ is a _language_.

</dfn>

<dfn>

__word.__ Given a language ${\cal{L},}$ we call each string ${\ell \in \cal{L}}$ a _word_.

</dfn>

<dfn>

__character.__ Given a word ${W = {c_0 ~ c_1 ~ \ldots ~ c_{n-1}}}$ of length ${n,}$ we call each symbol ${c_i \in \ell}$ with ${i = 0,1,\ldots,n-1}$ a _character_.

</dfn>

<dfn>

__character encoding.__ Let ${C}$ denote a character set, and ${\set{x_i}_{i=1}^{n}}$ denote a finite range of integers ${\set{x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n}}}$. Then the injection

$$
	\df{encode} : \set{x_i}_{i=1}^n \inj C
$$

is called a _character encoding_, whose domain is called the _code space_ ${\dom{\df{encode}},}$ and whose image ${\image{\df{(encode)}}}$ is called the _coded character set_. For each ${(x_i, c) \in \df{encode},}$ we call ${c}$ the _coded character_, and ${x_i}$ by the _code point_ of ${c.}$

</dfn>

## k-Permutation String

Given an alphabet ${\Sigma,}$ we define a _k-permutation string_ as a permutation of a subset of ${\Sigma.}$ That is, a string composed entirely of _distinct_ symbols.

<Algo>

__~k-permutation?~__

Let ${S}$ be a finite, non-empty string ${s_0,s_1,\ldots,s_{n-1}}$ over an alphabet ${\Sigma.}$ The function ${\df{k-permutation?}}$ returns ${0}$ if, and only if, each ${s_i}$ with ${0 \lt i \lt n-1}$ and ${i,n \in \nat}$ is distinct.

1. ${\let{L}{\len{S}}}$
2. ${\let{seen}{\df{new}~\df{hash-table}}}$
3. ${seen \Lleftarrow (S_0, 0)}$
4. ${\let{i}{1}}$
5. __while__ ${i \lt L}$ __do__
	1. __if__ ${S_i \in seen}$ __then return__ ${0}$
	2. __else__ ${seen \Lleftarrow (S_i, i)}$
	3. ${i \inc}$
6. __return__ ${1}$
