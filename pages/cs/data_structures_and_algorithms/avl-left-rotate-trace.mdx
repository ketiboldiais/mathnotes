Initial state: left-skewed tree. We start by having a ${temp}$ variable bind to ${b.}$ It's helpful to remember that every node in a binary tree has a left- and right-pointer, even if they aren't visualized. These pointers (and variables more generally), are akin to tentacles. All we're doing is having them stick.

Then we bind the ${temp}$ variable's right pointer to the root's left pointer.

<td width={`35%`}>
Now we bind the old root ${c}$ to ${temp}$'s right pointer. Notice that we've now "rotated" the tree. From a low-level perspective, we aren't "rotating" anything. All we're doing is aliasing and moving pointers.
