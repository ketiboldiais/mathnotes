# Data Structures & Algorithms
This volume contains notes on data structures and algorithms.

## Common Problem Patterns
Some problems are so commonly associated with certain algorithms that there are terms to watch out for.

| ~terms~                             | ~possible algorithm/technique~                                                         |
