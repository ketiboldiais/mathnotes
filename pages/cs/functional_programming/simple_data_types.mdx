# Simple Data Types

ML has the following base types:

| Type     | Sample Values                         | Comment                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `unit`   | `()`                                  | a trivial data type with a single value.                  |
| `bool`   | `true`, `false`                       | standard boolean values                                   |
| `int`    | `0`, `1`, `179`, `~5`                 | integer values                                            |
| `real`   | `0.0`, `3.14`, `~2.24`                | equivalent of floats in other languages; rational numbers |
| `char`   | `#"a"`, `#newline`                    | characters                                                |
| `string` | `"foo"`, `""`, `" "`, `"hello world"` | this is NOT the same as a list of characters              |

## Expressions & Variable Bindings

Before we study ML, we must first understand its foundational terminology
and concepts. In ML, a program is a sequence of __bindings__. Each
__binding__ has a __type__, which is checked. If it the binding passes its
type-check, then it is __evaluated__.

A binding's type depends on its __static environment__ &mdash; roughly, the
_types_ of the preceding bindings. How a binding is evaluated depends on
its __dynamic environment__ &mdash; roughly, the _values_ of the preceding
bindings. The term __environment__ usually refers to the dynamic
environment, and the term __context__ usually refers to the static
environment. The following are some common expressions in ML:

### If-expressions

The if-expression takes the form:

> if ${c}$ then ${e_1}$ else ${e_2}$

${b}$ must be an expression of type bool. ${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$ must have the
same types. The result same as ${e_1}$ and ${e_2.}$

### And-expression

The and-expression takes the form:

> ${e_1}$ andalso ${e_2}$

${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$ must both be of type bool. The result will also be of
type bool.

### Or-expression

The or-expression takes the form:

> ${e_1}$ orelse ${e_2}$

${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$ must both be of type bool.

### Not-expression

The not-expression has the form:

> NOT ${e}$

${e}$ must be of type bool.

### Addition Expresions

The addition expression has the form:

> ${e_1}$ + ${e_2}$

Either:

1. Both ${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$ are both of type int, or
2. both ${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$ are both of type real

The result is same as ${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$

### Subtraction Expression

The subtraction expression is written as:

> ${e_1}$ - ${e_2}$

Either:

1. Both ${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$ are both of type int; or
2. both ${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$ are both of type real

The result is same as ${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$

### Real Division Expression

The real division expression has the syntax:

> ${e_1}$/${e_2}$

where ${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$ must both be of type real.

### Integer Division

The integer division expression has the syntax:

> ${e_1}$ div ${e_2}$

where ${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$ must both be of type int.

### Multiplication Expression

The multiplication expression:

> ${e_1}$ \* ${e_2}$

Either:

1. Both ${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$ are both of type int; or
2. both ${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$ are both of type real

The result is same as ${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$ ${e_1 \cdot e_2.}$

### Comparison Expressions

The comparison expressions all look like what we'd see in other languages:

> ${e_1}$ < ${e_2}$

> ${e_1}$ > ${e_2}$

> ${e_1 \leq e_2}$

> ${e_1 \geq e_2}$

${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$ must both be of type `int` or both be of type `real`.
The result is a `bool`. The one outlier is equality:

> ${e_1}$ == ${e_2}$

${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$ must both be either:

1. unit,
2. int,
3. char, or
4. string.

They cannot be of type real.

### Concatenation Expression

The concatenation expression takes the form:

> ${e_1}$^${e_2}$

where ${e_1}$ and ${e_2}$ must both be string. The result is the
concatenation of ${e_1}$ and ${e_2.}$

## Variable Binding

There are many kinds of bindings in ML, but the simplest binding is the
__variable binding__. It takes the general form:

$$
	\texttt{val $v$ = $e$}
$$

In the syntax above, `val` is akeyword, ${v}$ is the _variable_, and ${e}$
is any expression. The semicolon is optional, but it is necessary in a REPL
(read-eval-print loop) to inform the _interpreter_ that the binding is
complete.

Every binding in ML has a__scope__, which we can think of as &#8220;where
it can be used.&#8221; The example above tells us the _syntax_ for a
variable binding (how to write it), but it does not tell us the _semantics_
(how the binding is type-checked and evaluated; its meaning). The semantics
of a variable binding are largely determined by the `⟨expression⟩`.

To type check the variable binding, the interpreter uses the _current
static environment_ (the types of preceding bindings) to type check the
`⟨expression⟩`. Once the `⟨expression⟩` is type-checked, the interpreter
produces a _ new static environment _ where the `⟨variable⟩` has the type
of the the `⟨expression⟩`.

To evaluate the variable binding, the interpreter uses the _current dynamic
environment_ (the _values_ of the preceding bindings) to evaluate the
`⟨expression⟩`. Once the `⟨expression⟩` is evaluated, the interpreter
produces a _ new dynamic environment _ where the current dynamic
environment now includes `⟨variable⟩` with the value of the
`⟨expression⟩`'s evaluation.

What is a __value__? A*value* is an expression that cannot be further
simplified &mdash; i.e., there is no more work to be done. For example,
`10` is a value, but `5 + 5` is not. Both `10` and `5 + 5`, however, are
_expressions_. In ML, all values are expressions, but not all expressions
are values. From the facts above, we have different _kinds of expressions_.
These kinds are defined as such.

| Kind of Expression | Syntax                                                                        | Type-checking                                                                                                                                               | Evaluation                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Whenever we learn a new construct in a programming language, there are
three things we must seek out and ingrain in memory:

1. What is the construct's syntax?
2. What is the rule for type-checking the construct?
3. What is the rule for evaluating the construct?

## Variable Immutability

In ML, bindings are immutable. This is in stark contrast to languages like
Java, Python, and JavaScript. Once we write:

```sml
val x = 8+9;
```

we create a dynamic environment where `x` maps to{" "} `17`. In this new
dynamic environment, `x` will always map to `17`. Unlike languages like
Java, there is no _assignment statement_ to change what `x` maps to.

Now, we are free to later write:

```sml
val x = 20;
```

but all this does is create a _different dynamic environment_ where
`x = 20` __shadows__ `x = 8+9`.

## Function Bindings

To define and use functions in ML, we create __function bindings__. For
those coming from a Python or Java background, functions in ML work much
the same way, with a few stark differences: (1) There is no notion of a
_class_; (2) there is no notion of a `return` statement. As an example,
consider a function that computes ${x^y}$ iff ${y \geq 0:}$

```sml
fun pow (x:int, y:int) = (* correct only for y >= 0 *)
	if y = 0
		then 1
	else x * pow(x,y-1)
```

The general syntax for a function in ML:

$$
	\texttt{fun $f$ ($a_1$ : $t_1$, ..., $a_n$ : $t_n$) = } \\
	~~e_1
	~~\vodts
	~~e_n
$$

In the syntax above the definition is prefaced by the keyword `fun`. ${f}$
is the function's name. It takes arguments ${a_1 \ldots a_n}$ of types
${t_1 \ldots t_n}$. The function's body is defined by the expressions
${e_1 \ldots e_n}$.

### Function Type-checking

To type check a function, the interpreter type-checks the function's body,
`⟨expressions⟩`, in a static environment, consisting of (1) all the earlier
bindings and (2) `arg-1` mapped to `type-1` ... `arg-n` mapped to `type-n`.
Because the static environment also includes `⟨function-name⟩`, the
function's body `⟨expressions⟩` can include a call to `⟨function-name⟩`
(i.e., a*recursive function call*).

### Evaluating Functions

A function is a value; we are merely adding `⟨function-name⟩` to be called
later. Thus, `⟨function-name⟩` is included in the dynamic environment in
the function body and for subsequent bindings.

However, `⟨function-name⟩` is not included in the preceding bindings, so
the order in which functions are defined is critical (i.e., the interpreter
cannot &#8220;jump forward&#8221; to a function definition later down the
program to evaluate the current expression).

### Function Calls

Function bindings are only useful if we can _call_ them. To do so, we write
a __function call__. The syntax:

$$
	f \space (a_1, \ldots, a_n)
$$

The parentheses are optional if there is exactly one argument:

$$
	f \space a
$$

Here is an example of a function call:

```sml
fun pow (x:int, y:int) = (* correct only for y >= 0 *)
	if y=0
		then 1
	else x * pow(x, y-1)

fun cube (x:int) =
	pow(x, 3)

val ans = cube(4)
```

## Recursive Functions

ML is a language that encourages recursion. While there are looping
constructs, ML implements them awkwardly. Because recursion is effectively
mandatory when using ML, it is important that we are as comfortable with
recursion as possible.

A __recursive__ function is a function that calls itself. Because the
function calls itself, we must always have a __base case__ &mdash; a call
to the function that immediately returns a value, ending the line of calls
made. The recursive function also requires an __inductive case__ &mdash;
all other calls not handled by the base case; the function calls itself
with smaller and smaller arguments.

### Linear Recursion

Here is a simple example: We want a function called `reverse(L)` that takes
a list `L` and reverses the order of its elements. For example, given the
list `[0, 1, 2]`, return `[2, 1, 0]`.

First question: What is the base case? Here, the base case is the empty
list, `[]`. Next question: Is the hypothesis true for the base case? I.e.,
if the argument `[]` is passed, do we get back a reverse of `[]`? Yes, it
is. The reverse of `[]` is `[]`. In other words, `reverse([]) = []`.

Third question: What is the inductive step? To perform the inductive step,
we consider a simple case. Suppose `L` has only one element; `[0]`. Let's
say that the head of `L` is `h`, and the tail of `L` is the list `T`. In
the case of a single element &mdash; `[0]` &mdash; `h` is `0` and `T` is
`[]`. To construct the reverse then, we want to reverse `T` and insert to
its end `h`. Thus, for the single element `[0]`, the reverse is `[0]`.

Now consider a two-element list, `[0, 1]`. Here, `h` is `0` and `T` is
`[1]`. We take the tail of the list, `[1]`, reverse that, `[1]`, and insert
`0` &mdash; [1, 0].

The function:

```sml
fun reverse(L) =
	if L = nil
		then nil
	else reverse(tl L) @ [hd L]

val list1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
val list2 = reverse(list1)
```

```bash
val reverse = fn : ''a list -> ''a list
val list1 = [0,1,2,3,4] : int list
val list2 = [4,3,2,1,0] : int list
```

The function above is an example of __linear recursion__: Each recursive
call either (1) results in another recursive call with a smaller argument,
or (2) results in the base case. However, we can also perform _nonlinear
recursion_.

### Nonlinear Recursion

In __nonlinear recursion__, the recursion involves more than one recursive
call.

## Pairs

As we already know, a good programming language provides ways of building
compound data from simpler data. The simplest way of forming compound data
in ML is through __pairs__. To build a pair, we use the following syntax:

$$
	(e_1, e_2)
$$

When a pair is built, ${e_1}$ is evaluated to ${v_1}$ and ${e_2}$ is
evaluated to ${v_2}$. In doing so, the pair, as a whole, is evaluated to
${(v_1, v_2)}$, a value. Because a pair is evaluated to a value, a pair can
consist of pairs:

$$
	(P_1, P_2) \\ [1em] \darr \\[0.3em] (v_1, v_2) \\ [1em] \darr \\[0.3em] ((e_1, e_2) (e_1, e_2))
$$

The type of a pair is `t1 * t2` where ${t_1}$ is the type of the first
part, ${v_1,}$ and ${t_2}$ is type of the second part, ${v_2.}$

To access the values ${v_1}$ and ${v_2}$ in a pair, we must write a
function. The following is a function that accesses and sums the parts of a
pair:

```sml
fun sum_two_pairs (pr1 : int*int, pr2 : int*int) =
	(#1 pr1) + (#2 pr1) + (#1 pr2) + (#2 pr2)
```

Notice how we access the parts with `#1` and `#2`. Here is another function
that takes a pair to return an answer with two parts, a quotient, and a
remainder:

```sml
fun div_mod (x : int, y : int) =
	(x div y, x mod y)
```

Here is another function that sorts a pair:

```sml
fun sort_pair(pr : int*int) =
	if (#1 pr) < (#2 pr)
		then pr
	else ((#2 pr), (#1 pr))
```

## Tuples and Lists

A pair is really a 2-tuple. ML allows us to have ${n-\text{tuples}.}$ For
example, a 3-tuple (a triple):

```sml
(*
	a 3-tuple
	type: int*int*int
*)
(2, 4, 6)
```

### Nesting Tuples

Tuples are of fixed but __arbtirary arity__ &mdash; we can nest tuples
however much we would like:

```sml
(*
	Below is a 3-tuple containing a 2-tuple
	Type: int*(int*int)*int
*)

(2, (4, 6), 8)

(*
Below is a 2-tuple containing a 2-tuple
Type: int*(bool*int)
*)

(2, (true, 4))
```

## Lists

We can nest pairs as much as we would like, but it can be difficult to
determine how many parts are in a pair, since the type determines the
amount of data contained in a pair. To get around this difficulty, ML
provides __lists__. A list containing ${n}$ values is initialized with the
following syntax:

$$
	\texttt{[$v_1$, $v_2$, \ldots, $v_n$]}
$$

Note that unlike tuples, lists are __homogeneous__ &mdash; a list's members
must all be of the same type.

The _empty list_,`[]`, is the list with 0 elements. However, while it does
not have any elements, it is a value nevertheless, and it evaluates to
itself immediately. With the empty list `[]`,`null` evaluates to true. For
non-empty lists, `null` evaluates to `false`. Here are some useful
operators for lists:

| Operator | Semantics                                                                                                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `null`   | evaluates to true if the list is the empty list []; otherwise false for non-empty lists                             |
| `hd`     | return the first element of the list; i.e., the head of the list; if the list is empty, an exception is raised      |
| `t1`     | return the list without the first element; i.e., the tail of the list; if the list is empty, an exception is raised |

Here are some functions operating on lists:

```sml
fun sum_list (x_list : int list) =
	if null x_list
		then 0
	else hd(x_list) + sum_list(t1 x_list)

fun countdown (x : int) =
	if x=0
		then []
	else x :: countdown(x-1)

fun append (x_list : int list, y_list : int list) =
	if null x_list
		then y_list
	else (hd x_list) :: append(t1 x_list, y_list)

```

Functions using lists are almost always recursive because a list has an
unknown length. When writing recursive functions for lists, there are two
things to determine:

1. The base case: What should the result be for an empty list?
2. The recursive case: How can the answer be expressed in terms of the
   answer for the rest of the list?

Thinking of terms of recursion rather than loops and assignment statements
can both simplify a problem considerably, as well as yield a greater
understanding of the problem parameters.

## Let Expressions.

In ML, the `let` expression is what gives us _local bindings_, and as an
expression, we can place it anywhere an expression may be placed. The `let`
expression takes the form:

$$
	\texttt{let $b_1$, $b_2$, \dots $b_n$ in $e$ end}
$$

Above: Each ${b}$ is a binding, ${e}$ is an expression, and the symbols
`let`, `in`, and `end` are keywords.

To evaluate a `let` expression, we evaluate each ${b}$ using all earlier
bindings in evaluating the `let` expression and create a larger environment
for the subsequent bindings.

Recall that every binding in ML has a scope. For the `let` expression, the
scope of a binding contained therein is the later bindings in that `let`
expression, and the _body_ of the `let` expression &mdash; the expression
${exp.}$ The value of the entire `let` expresion is the value of ${e.}$
Accordingly, the type of the entire `let` expression is the type of the
value of ${e.}$ Here is a simple `let` expression:

```sml
let val x = 1
in
	(let val x = 2 in x+1 end) + (let val y = x+2 in y+1 end)
end
```

`let` expressions in ML are extremely handy with functions. For example, we
can use a`let` expression to bind a function, since a function is itself a
binding. This leads to common design pattern:

> Convention. If a*helper function* is needed by only one other function
> and is unlikely to be useful elsewhere, we ought to bind it locally to
> the parent function:

For example, here is a function that produces the list `[1, 2, ..., 𝑥]`:

```sml
fun countUp_from_1 (x:int) =
	let fun count (from:int, to:int) =
		if from=to
			then to :: []
		else from :: count(from+1, to)
	in
		count(1,x)
	end
```

How does the code above work? First, we defined a function called
`countUp_from_1()`. This function consumes an `int` type value, stored in
the `int` type variable `x`. Inside the body of `countUp_from_1`, we
execute the function `count()`. The function `count` is _local_ to the
function `countUp_from_1()`. How? Because we defined it through a let
expression inside the body of `countUp_from_1`.

Now, `count()` takes two arguments: (1) an `int` type value stored in the
`int` type variable `from`, and (2) an `int` type value stored in the `int`
type variable `to`. However, given that the function `countUp_from_1()`
calls the function `count()` with the arguments `1` and `x`, the variable
`from` is bound to the value `1`, and the variable `to` is bound to
whatever `int` type value we passed as an argument into `countUp_from_1()`.

Inside `count()`, we ask several questions. First, `from=to`, which is, Is
`from` equal to `?` If it is, then return the singleton list `[to]`. If it
not, then ask the second question, `else`. The answer to `else` is always
`true`, so we return a list starting with `from` and ending with
`count(from+1, to)`. So, for example, `countUp_from_1(5)`, where
`countUp_from_1` is ${f}$ and `count` is ${c}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
	&\texttt{f(5)} \\
	&\texttt{c(1, 5)} \\
	&\texttt{[1, c(2, 5)]} \\
	&\texttt{[1, 2, c(3, 5)]} \\
	&\texttt{[1, 2, 3, c(4, 5)]} \\
	&\texttt{[1, 2, 3, 4, c(5, 5)]} \\
	&\texttt{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Although the algorithm works, there is room for optimization. First, notice
that `count()`'s first parameter, `from:int`, always has the value `1`.
Second, notice that `count()`'s second parameter, `to:int`, is always the
value stored in `countUp_from_1()`'s second parameter, `x`. Can we use `x`?
Of course! Never forget the core rule of dynamic environments in ML: To
evaluate a binding, we use all of the preceding bindings. Accordingly,
`count()` is absolutely free to use `x`. Thus, we can write the function
more concisely:

```sml
fun countUp_from_1 (x:int) =
	let fun count (from:int) =
		if from = x
			then x::[]
		else from :: count(from+1)
	in
		count 1
	end
```

The optimization above demonstrates a common technique in functional
programming:

> In defining functions, reuse variables within the function's scope.

Be aware: The technique above is unique to functional programming
languages. Unfortunately, many languages absolutely prohibit such
practices. In functional programming &mdash; and programming in general
&mdash; local variables should be preferred over _global variables_. For
starts, locals make code easier to read rather than globals. For example,
consider the following function that returns the maximum value in a list:

```sml
fun max (x_list : int list) =
	if null x_list
		then 0
	else if null (t1 x_list)
		then hd x_list
	else if hd x_list > max(t1 x_list)
		then hd x_list
	else max(t1 x_list)
```

The code above asks 4 different questions:

1. Is `x_list` the empty list?
   - Yes ${\nc}$ evaluate to `0`.
   - No ${\nc}$ ask the next question.
2. Is the tail of `x_list` the empty list? (i.e., Is the list a singleton
   list?)
   - Yes ${\nc}$ evaluate to the head of `x_list`.
   - No ${\nc}$ ask the next question.
3. Is the head of `x_list` greater than the maximum of the tail of the
   list?
   - Yes ${\nc}$ evaluate to the head of `x_list`
   - No ${\nc}$ ask the next question.
4. `else`.
   - evaluate to the maximum of the tail of the list.

What is the problem with this algorithm? The problem is we are calling
`max()` twice recursively. This is an example of a common recursive error,
the __exponential blowup__ &mdash; `max()` asks for `max()` twice, and in
both those `max()` calls, `max()` is asked twice (now 4 `max()` calls), and
in each of those 4 `max()` calls, `max()` is asked twice (now 16 `max()`
calls), etc. If we passed into `max()` the value of `countUp_from_1(100)`,
we would execute ${2^{100}}$ calls.

`let` expressions solve this problem: Compute the{" "} `max` of the tail
once, store that result in `tail_max`, and use `tail_max` as the
comparison:

```sml
fun max (x_list : int list) =
	if null x_list
		then 0
	else if null (t1 x_list)
		then hd x_list
	else
		let val tail_max = max(t1 x_list)
		in
			if hd x_list > tail_max
				then hd x_list
			else tail_max
		end
```

With the code above, we go through the same first two questions, and if
they are both `false`, then we go through the `else` question: First, bind
the value of the max of the list's tail to the variable `tail_max`. If the
head of `x_list` is greater than `tail_max`, evaluate to the head of
`x_list`. Otherwise, evaluate to `tail_max`. So, for example, suppose we
wrote `max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`. Where `max()` is ${M,}$ `hd` is ${h}$, `t1`
is ${t,}$ ${\ell}$ is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and ${v}$ is `tail_max`:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		&\texttt{M($\ell$)} \\
		&\texttt{M([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])} \\
		&\texttt{h($\ell$) > v} \\
		&\texttt{h($\ell$) > M(t($\ell$))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > M([2, 3, 4, 5])} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (h($\ell$) > v)} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (h($\ell$) > M(t($\ell$)))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (2 > M([3, 4, 5]))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (2 > (3 > v))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (2 > (3 > M(t($\ell$))))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (2 > (3 > M[4, 5]))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (2 > (3 > (4 > v)))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (2 > (3 > (4 > M(t($\ell$)))))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (2 > (3 > (4 > M([5]))))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (2 > (3 > (4 > (5 > v))))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (2 > (3 > (4 > (5 > M(t($\ell$))))))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (2 > (3 > (4 > (5 > M([])))))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (2 > (3 > (4 > (5 > 0))))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (2 > (3 > (4 > (5))))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (2 > (3 > (5)))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (2 > (5))} \\
		&\texttt{1 > (5)} \\
		&\texttt{5} \\
	\end{aligned}
$$

## Options

There is a small problem with the algorithm above. The answer to the first
question, `null x_list` is `0`. But this isn't logically correct. The
maximum value of an empty list isn't zero, because there are no values in
an empty list to compare with in the first place. We should avoid making
such illogical statements. So what can we do? We could raise an exception.
However, a better way would be to use an `option`. In ML, an `option` is a
data type with only one of two values: `NONE` or `SOME`. The `option` value
`NONE` represents _nothingness_, or &#8220;carries nothing.&#8221; The
`option` value `SOME 𝑒`, where ${e}$ is an expression, represents
_existence_, or &#8220;carries something.&#8221; More specifically, the
value `SOME 𝑒` will evaluate ${e}$ to a value ${v,}$ at which point
`SOME 𝑒` becomes the option carrying the one and only value ${v.}$

Like `null`, we can ask whether a value is `SOME 𝑒` or `NONE`. The operator
`isSome` evaluates to `false` if its argument is `NONE`. And if we want to
access the value carried by a `SOME`, we use the operator `valOf`. Using
options, we can rewrite the code above as such:

```sml
fun max (x_list : int list) =
	if null x_list
		then NONE
	else
		let val tail_max = max(t1 x_list)
		in
			if isSome tail_max andalso valOf tail_max > hd x_list
				then tail_max
			else
				SOME (hd x_list)
		end
```

## Errors Generally

Errors in ML fall into three groups: (1) _syntax errors_, (2) _type
errors_, and (3) _runtime errors_.

__Syntax errors__ are errors caused by writing something incorrectly.
Incorrect meaning we have written something in violation of ML's syntax.

__Type errors__ are errors caused by failing to pass a type check. These
errors occur when we fail to follow the type checking rules; e.g., adding
an `int` type variable to a`bool` type variable.

__Runtime errors__ are errors that occur during evaluation. This might be
because we used an operator incorrectly, or because we wrote a recursive
function that _bottoms out_ &mdash; making too many recursive calls such
that the program terminates.

Errors are not caught by ML can be broadly classified as __logic errors__.
Here, we complied with syntax and semantics, so we do not see any syntax,
type, or runtime errors, but our program does something outside of our
expections. Perhaps it hangs (enters an infinite loop), returns an
unexpected value, or returns an expected value but not in the way we
intended.

The errors above all occur in sequence. In other words, in order of
occurrence, we will see syntax errors, then type errors, then runtime
errors last. This means that if we see a runtime error, then we did not
have a syntax or type error, but if we see a syntax error, we do not know
if there is a type or runtime error, at least not yet.
