# Networks

_This chapter provides an overview of computer networks. We open with a
question._

1. [Definitions](#definitions)

## Definitions

> **~network~.** A _network_ is a non-empty weighted digraph ${N,}$ where each
> vertex of ${N}$ is a _machine_, and each edge in ${N}$ is a _link_. The weight
> of each link is called the link's _bandwidth_.

> **~communication~.** A _communication_ is a map
> ${C: (A_N \to f) \mapsto B_N,}$ where ${A_N}$ and ${B_N}$ are machines on a
> network ${N,}$ and ${(A_N \times F)}$ is a set of files in ${A_N.}$ We will
> denote each file in ${A_N}$ with the symbol ${\mo{f}.}$

~remark~. There are three key factors that influence how fast a file is
transferred from ${A_N}$ to ${B_N:}$ (1) **_distance_** — the length of the path
from ${A_N}$ and ${B_N;}$ (2) **_traversal count_** — the number of traversals
required to completely map a file ${\mo{f}}$ to ${A_N;}$ (3) **_file size_** —
the number of bytes comprising ${\mo{f}.}$

> **~protocol~.** A _protocol_ is a set of axioms. That is, a set of
> propositions guaranteed to be true.

~remark~. The definition above is nonstandard, but it is the working definition
of these materials. A more common definition is that a protocol is a set of
rules, but in this author's experience explaining protocols, the common
definition almost always leads to a follow-up question: What is the punishment?
This is a perfectly fair question because of what the term _protocol_ connotes.
Unfortunately, it isn't productive. We avoid the distraction by defining
protocols more generally — they're simply facts that we accept as true before we
do anything further.

> **~HTTP~.** The _hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)_ is a protocol whose
> axioms concern HTML file transfers.

~example~. If we want to see `cnn.com`, we must request the document from a
server. That server is not the same machine as ours — it runs a different
operating system, different software, different interfaces, different drivers,
and so on. Hence, we need a _protocol_ that our system, the _client_, and the
server agree to. HTTP is one such protocol. It contains many propositions. For
example: _The string ${\lq \mo{GET} \rq}$ means that the client is asking for a
specific page_. Even though the server and the client are entirely different
systems, both know what ${\lq \mo{GET} \rq}$ means. And if there is shared
meaning, there is communication.

> **~get~.** The string ${\lq \mo{GET} \dk x \rq}$ means _return the data
> object_ ${x.}$

> **~post~.** The string ${\lq \mo{POST} \dk x \rq}$ means _save the data
> object_ ${x.}$

> **~post~.** The string ${\lq \mo{PUT} \dk x \rq}$ means _update the data
> object_ ${x.}$

> **~post~.** The string ${\lq \mo{DELETE} \dk x \rq}$ means _delete the data
> object_ ${x.}$

## APIs
> __~interface~.__ A function that encapsulates one or more procedures. 

~example~. ${n!}$ is an interface for ${n \times (n-1) \ldots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1.}$

~example~. ${\dsum{i=k}{n} a_k}$ is an interface for

$$
	a_{k} + a_{k+1} + \ldots + a_{k + n - 1}
$$

~remark~. An _interface_ is just another word for _abstraction_. The only difference is informal. An interface connotes some _user_ and some _creator_. The creator creates the procedures, and constructs abstractions (interfaces) that the user employs to make use of those procedures. 

~example~. Below, ${\tx{isEven}}$ is an interface for the procedure from lines 1 through 2.

<Algo>
- Input: ${n \in \nat}$
- Output: Boolean

1. __function__ ${\tx{IsEven}(n)}$
	1. If ${n \rem 2 = 0,}$ return true.
	2. Else return false.

</Algo>

> __~api~.__ Let ${A}$ be a set of programs. The _API (Application Programming Interface)_ of ${A,}$ denoted ${\df{api}_A,}$ is a map ${\df{api}_A: I \to P,}$ where ${I}$ is a set of interfaces and ${P \subseteq A.}$

I.e., an API is a set of interfaces, where each interface maps to a program available to the public. For example, ${A}$ might be an application that generates a checkerboard (a grid of alternating black and white squares). The set of programs may include procedures ${\tx{isEven}}$ and ${\tx{isOdd},}$ but those are not procedures we want available to the public, since they aren't the purpose of generating a checkerboard. Instead, the API only includes interfaces such as ${\tx{makeCheckerboard},}$ ${\tx{changeColorScheme},}$ etc.

~remark~. Designing APIs is a field onto itself. It requires us to consider user experience, which is beyond mathematics.

### REST APIs
> __~rest api~.__ A _REST API_ is an API without any notion of state.

~example~. Let ${A}$ be a user, and let ${X}$ be an API. ${A}$ uses ${X}$ at time ${t}$ and ${X}$ executes ${A}$'s calls. ${A}$ uses ${X}$ again at time ${t + n,}$ where ${n \in \pint.}$ Encountering ${A}$'s use, ${X}$ has no recollection of ${A}$ making a request at time ${t.}$
