# Implementing a Virtual Machine

This chapter is a continuation of the
[Virtual Machines Chapter](virtual_machines), providing a rough
implementation of a virtual machine in C++. The machine will implement a
virtual machine language called _VLang (Virtual Language)_. In later
sections. The language in this section will be later used to implement a
higher language called _Tekoi_.

## VLang

First, we create a file called `VLang.cpp`. This file contains the class
definition for VLang.
