# Linkers

Once we've created a slighly complicated project in C or C++, our project
likely comprises multiple files. Assuming these files are necessary for the
project to work, they must each be compiled and _linked_. For example, say
we have the following C files. First, a file called `main.c`:

```c
int sum(int *a, int n);

int arr[2] = {1,2};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
	int val = sum(array, 2);

	return 0;
}
```

The function `sum` is declared in `main.c`, but defined in a different file
called `sum.c`:

```c
int sum(int *a, int n) {
	int i, s = 0;
	for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		s += a[i];
	}
	return s;
}
```

The two programs above are translated and linked by a program called the
__compiler driver__. Within the compiler driver are two programs: (1) the
_compiler_ and (2) the _linker_. As we saw in the compiler unit, the
compiler itself consists of several programs: the _tokenizer_, _parser_,
and _translator_. After we compile the two source code files above, we get
two output files: `main.o` and `sum.o`. These two files contain the lower
level code returned from the translator. To get these programs to work, we
send these files to the linker.

With modern compilers, all of this can be done in one line:

```bash
gcc -Og -o myProgram main.c sum.c
```

When we write the line above:

1.  `main.c` and `sum.c` are translated by the compiler's translator to
    `main.o` and `sum.o`. These translations are done separately, which is
    why we see two different _object files_.
2.  The `main.o` and `sum.o` files are then sent to the linker, which takes
    the two files and links them into a single _executable_ called
    `myProgram`. This is a file containing all of the code and data for all
    the functions defined in `main.c` and `sum.c`
3.  To execute the program, we _execute_ the _executable_ (hence the name):

        ```bash
        ./myProgram
        ```

## Why Do Linkers Exist?

Several reasons. First, linkers are what allow us to modularize our
projects. Following the _single responsibility principle_, it's always a
good idea to separate our project's components into individual files. But,
in doing so, we run into a problem: How do we ensure the system executes
the files in the order we have in mind? By ensuring all of the files' code
lines are executed in order. And the easiest way to do that is to merge all
of the code lines into a single file — the linker's principle job.

Second, we want the ability to compile projects separately. It may not seem
all that valuable for small to medium-sized projects (in fact, it may seem
annoying), but imagine a project with thousands of files (or more
accurately, dependencies). If we had to compile the entire project just to
test one file, we would waste valuable development time. The more
dependencies we have, the longer compilation takes (extremely large
projects can wade into the hours or even days territory). This is more
apparent when we realize that we use dependencies that we didn't write
ourselves. Why should we have to waste compile time for `stdio` header
file?

Third, linkers provide a way to use memory efficiently. Linking object file
𝐴 and object file 𝐵, the linker will aggregate 𝐴 and 𝐵's shared functions
into a single file. This is particularly valuable when we use functions
from external libraries like `math.h`. Linkers have two options for doing
so:

1. __Static linking__. In creating the executable, the linker will ensure
   only the library code actually used is included. For example, if we just
   used `sin` function in `math.h`, the linker won't also include the
   myriad of other `math.h` functions: `cos`, `cosh`, `asin`, and so on.
2. __Dynamic linking.__ The executable files don't contain any library
   code. Instead, a single copy of the library code is shared across all
   executing process.

## Types of Object Files

Object files are also called _modules_. There are tree types:

1. __Relocatable object files__. These object files are identified with the
   `.o` extension. They're the object files outputted by the compiler (or
   assembler), to be fed to the linker. They contain code and data in a
   form that can be combined with other `.o` files.
2. __Executable object file.__ These object files are identified as `a.out`
   (if we don't give the linker a name to use). They contain code and data
   that can be copied directly into memory and executed. They're also
   called _executables_ — the files outputted by linkers.
3. __Shared object file__. These are a special kind of relocatable object
   file that can be loaded into memory and linked dynamically at load or
   run time. They're identified with the exten `.so` (or, on Windows,
   `.dll`, _dynamically linked libraries_).

## What's Inside an Object File?

We can see what's inside an object file by running the command:

```bash
objdump -rd <executable-name>
```

Doing so for our `prog` executable, we get the following:

```bash
prog:   file format mach-o 64-bit x86-64

Above, we see the Assembly code we'd expect if we had instead written the
entire program in one file (with address differences of course). The key
point is, the linker's sole job is to ensure all of these instructions are
lumped into a single file in proper order.

As an aside, notice the large amount of `nop` instructions (no operation).
The array of `nop` instructions is called a __nop sled__, and it's used to
prevent buffer overflows.

Object files will all look generally look like the output above.[^note_obj]
Where object files differ (slightly) is in formatting.

[^note_obj]:
    In actuality, the object file is just a long sequence of ones and
    zeros. Tools like `objdump` transform this sequence into human-readable
    Assembly

## Object File Formats

Object file formats differ from system to system. The first format was
`a.out`, used by the computers at Bell Labs and early Unix systems. Today,
Windows uses the _Portable Executable (PE) format_, and Mac OS X uses the
_Mach-O format_. Linux and other Unix systems use _Executable and Linkable
Format (ELF)_.

Regardless of format, the general structure is largely the same. The file
is divided into different sections, each with a particular purpose. The
sections are presented below in order:

| Section        | Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `header`       | 16-byte sequence that describes the system's word size and byte ordering; type of the object file; machine type; locations of the sections                                                                                                                                        |
| `.text`        | The program's machine code. If we have local and static variables, they're placed here to be handled at runtime on the stack.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `.rodata`      | Read-only data: E.g., format strings in `printf` calls, jump tables for switch statements                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `.data`        | Initialized global/static variables not set to zero. I.e., data that persists across jumps.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `.bss`         | Uninitialized global/static variables, or global/static variables set to zero. At runtime, these variables are all set to zero, and they occupy no space in memory. `bss` originally stood for "block started by symbol", but is often known colloquially as "Better save space." |
| `.symtab`      | The object file's symbol table. For executables, the symbol table will not contain entries for local variables. But it will for `.o` files (the object files outputted by the compiler)                                                                                           |
| `.rel.text`    | Places in the `.text` section that will have to be changed when the linker combines the object file with another. `rel` stands for "relocation."                                                                                                                                  |
| `.rel.data`    | Places in the `.data` section that will have to be changed when the linker combines the object file with another.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `.debug`       | If the object file is generated with a debugging flag, a symbol table with entries for local variables and custom type definitions. Tools like `gdb` and `valgrind` work by manipulating this section.                                                                            |
| `.line`        | If the object file is generated with a debugging flat, mappings between line numbers in the source code file and the machine code instructions in the `.text` section.                                                                                                            |
| `.strtab`      | A table of string values, where each string value is the symbol in the symbol tables, and the section names.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| _header table_ | A table containing descriptions of each section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## The Keyword Static

The `static` keyword has several meanings because there are several usage
scenarios:

1. Static variables.
2. Static functions.

To understand the meanings, we should lay out the different kinds of
constructs a higher-level language might have:

| Construct                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| local non-static variable  | Variables that can only be read inside a specific function's body in the file. These variables are stored in the stack.                                                                                                                                                |
| local non-static function  | Functions that can only be called inside a specific function's body in the file. These variables are stored in the stack.                                                                                                                                              |
| global non-static variable | A variable that can be read by all functions in all of the linked files.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| global non-static function | A function defined at the global level inside a file. If their headers are written in a linked file, they can be called by functions in the linked file. They can always be called by their sibling functions (other functions inside the the file they're defined in) |
| local static variable      | A variable that can be read/written across all calls to the function.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Illustrating with C:

```c
static int x = 5; // Global static variable. Only f, g, and h can read/write x.

int n = 4 // Global non-static variable. f, g, h, and all functions in linked files can read/write n.

static void a() { // global static function
	printf("foo\n");
}

// f, g, and h are all global non-static functions
int f() {
	static int y = 5; // Local static variable. First f call uses y=5, all subsequent f calls use the value updated by the previous f call.
	if (y == 0) return y;
	else {
		y--;
		return f();
	}
}

int g() {
	int m = 2; // local non-static variable. Each m call get its own, new copy of m.
	return m;
}

static void u(int) // local static function, used only by h
int h(int t) { // t is an argument, which is a local non-static variable
	u(t);
	return t;
}
static void u(int i) { // definition of u
	printf("%d", i);
}
```

## How Do Linkers Work?

When we send object files to the linker, it executes the following
procedure:

1. __Symbol resolution.__ For each file, resolve all symbols.
2. __Merging.__ For each file, merge all of the instructions and data into
   single sections.
3. __Relocation.__ Relocate the sections into their final absolute memory
   locations in the executable.

We'll go through each of these steps in turn.

### Symbol Resolution

The purpose of symbol resolution is take each symbol (the names for certain
functions and variables in the source code files) and bind it with one, and
only one, definition (the initializations of those names). To understand
what this means, we revisit compilers.

From the [compiler section](compilers), we saw that after a compiler
receives source code, it will generate a
[symbol table](compilers#symbol-tables). This is a table containing the
names, memory sizes, and other information about identifiers (variable and
function names) used in the program. Each of these identifiers are called
__symbols__. Because each source code file results in its own object file,
the object files will contain their own symbol tables.

The symbol tables generated by the compiler will often contain a large
amount of information. This includes symbols for function arguments and
local. The linker, however, is only looking at three kinds of symbols.
Suppose we have two source code files, 𝐴 and 𝐵, compiled to their
respective object files.

1. __Global symbols__. These are identifiers defined in 𝐴 that can be
   referenced and used in 𝐵, or vice versa. In languages like C, these take
   the form of _nonstatic functions_ or _global variables_.
2. __External symbols.__ These are identifiers used in 𝐴 or 𝐵 that are
   defined elsewhere. For example, if 𝐵 uses the `math.h` module and uses
   the `acosh` function, `acosh` is called an _external_. It's defined
   outside of 𝐵 but used by 𝐵.
3. __Local symbols__. These are identifiers defined globally in 𝐴 that can
   only be used by 𝐴. Or, in 𝐵's case, the identifiers defined globally in
   𝐵 that can only be used by 𝐵. In languages like C, these are are called
   _static functions_ or _global variables_.

What about all of the local identifiers? Those are not looked at by the
linker. Remember, the linker's operates at the file (or global) level. The
linker will not touch locals — it assumes that the identifiers are already
in the correct place, ready to go.

When the linker receives the object files, it will go through each file,
and _resolve_ the __symbol references__: an identifier associated with a
symbol. For example, in the two programs we saw previously:

```c
// main.c
int sum(int *a, int n);

int arr[2] = {1,2};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
	int val = sum(arr, 2);

	return 0;
}
```

```c
// sum.c
int sum(int *a, int n) {
	int i, s = 0;
	for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		s += a[i];
	}
	return s;
}
```

In `main.c`, we have two symbols for the linker: `array` and `main`. We
also have symbol reference: `sum`. This symbol refers to the `sum` defined
in `sum.c` In `sum.c` we have one symbol: `sum`.

For example, compiling the files into a single object file called `prog`
and running the command:

```bash
objdump -t prog
```

we get the following output:

```bash
0000000100000000 g     F __TEXT,__text __mh_execute_header
0000000100004000 g     O __DATA,__data _arr
0000000100003f30 g     F __TEXT,__text _main
0000000100003f60 g     F __TEXT,__text _sum
0000000000000000         _UND_ dyld_stub_binder
```

Let's put this information into an actual table:

| Offset             | bind | Type    | Section            | Name                  |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| `0000000100000000` | `g`  | `F`     | `__TEXT,__text`    | `__mh_execute_header` |
| `0000000100004000` | `g`  | `O`     | `__DATA,__data`    | `_arr`                |
| `0000000100003f30` | `g`  | `F`     | `__TEXT,__text`    | `_main`               |
| `0000000100003f60` | `g`  | `F`     | `__TEXT,__text`    | `_sum`                |
| `0000000000000000` |      | `_UND_` | `dyld_stub_binder` |                       |

Each row in the table is a symbol entry, and each entry has the following
fields:

1. The __symbol offset__ contains the offset values for each symbol. We can
   think of this value as corresponding to the symbol's index in its
   respective section. This is how the linker quickly finds the symbols.
2. The __binding__ indicates whether the symbol is a global, static, or
   reference.
3. The __type__ indicates whether the symbol is a function (`F`), object
   (`O`), or undefined (`_UND_`).
4. The __section__ indicates which section the symbol belongs to. In this
   case, we see that it's either the _text_ section, or the _data section_.
5. Finally, the __name__ field provides the symbol's name.

The last row, `dyld_stub_binder`, is an output we may or may not see
depending on the compiler we use. The output above was generated on Mac OS
X, which uses dynamic linking. The `dyld_stub_binder` is a function that
takes a symbol and effectively designates it as a symbol to be dynamically
linked. We'll cover this in more detail when we get to dynamic linking. If
we had instead written:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int sum(int *a, int n);

int arr[2] = {1,2};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
	int val = sum(arr, 2);
	printf("%d\n", val);
	return 0;
}
```

we would see the symbol table:

```bash
0000000100008008 l     O __DATA,__data __dyld_private
0000000100000000 g     F __TEXT,__text __mh_execute_header
0000000100008010 g     O __DATA,__data _arr
0000000100003ef0 g     F __TEXT,__text _main
0000000100003f40 g     F __TEXT,__text _sum
0000000000000000         _UND_ _printf
0000000000000000         _UND_ dyld_stub_binder
```

Now, back to symbol resolution. Say we wanted to link two files, `main.c`
and `foo.c`:

```c
// main.c
void foo();
int main() {
	foo();
	return 0;
}
```

```c
// foo.c
void foo() {
	printf("foo!\n");
}
```

When the linker receives `main.o` and `foo.o`, the symbol tables look as
follows. For `main.o`, we have:

```bash
0000000000000000 g     F __TEXT,__text _main
0000000000000000         _UND_ _foo
```

and for `foo.o`, we have:

```bash
0000000000000000 g     F __TEXT,__text _foo
0000000000000000         _UND_ _printf
```

Notice how the entries in the symbol table are undefined. This is because
we're only seeing the symbol tables outputted by the compiler. All the
compiler does is create symbol tables for the code in the file its given.
It doesn't have a clue about what's going on in some other file. Thus, when
the compiler encounters these undefined symbols, it marks the entry as
undefined, indicating to the linker: "This is probably defined in some
other module."

The linker's job at the symbol resolution stage is as follows:

1. Fill in those undefined entries.
2. If there are duplicate entries, pick one so there aren't duplicates.

This is done by creating a single large symbol table, as we saw earlier.
Say we link the `main.o` and `foo.o` into `prog`.

Just to remind ourselves, the linker's job is to take the two symbol tables
from `main.o` and `foo.o`:

<Grid cols={2}>

<Stack data={["main.o", "data", "bss", "text", "..."]} />

<Stack data={["foo.o", "data", "bss", "text", "..."]} />

</Grid>

and create a single monolithic symbol table for `prog`:

<Stack
	data={[
		"prog",
		"main data",
		"main bss",
		"main text",
		"main ...",
		"foo data",
		"foo bss",
		"foo text",
		"foo ...",
	]}
	scale={50}
/>

#### Resolution Procedure

Once the linker receives the object files, it begins going through each
file's symbol table. When the linker encounters a reference, it will look
at the symbol table for a definition. If it finds the definition, it
_binds_ the reference to the definition. This effectively resolves the
reference. If it doesn't find a definition, it flags the reference and
continues.

The linker resolves symbols by relying on a key fact — when the compiler
generates its symbol tables, it classifies each symbol as one of the
following:

1. a _strong symbol_, or
2. a _weak symbol_

__Strong symbols__ are symbols for global functions and initialized global
variables. __Weak symbols__ are symbols for uninitialized global variables
and variables declared with the keyword `extern`. We'll see why this fact
is important in a moment.

When the linker encounters a reference to a local symbol, the process is
easy enough: the linker doesn't have to do anything. The compiler already
did the heavy lifting of ensuring that the symbol had only one definition.

When the linker encounters a strong symbol defined in one symbol table and
the same strong symbol in defined in another symbol table, it will throw an
error: "multiple definition of ...".

When the linker encounters an entry marked as undefined, it flags, or
marks, the entry for revisiting and continues. From then on, there are two
possibilities:

1. The symbol is defined in another module, or
2. the symbol isn't defined at all.

If it's possibility (2) the linker will throw the link error **undefined
reference error**. If it's (1), the procedure is a little more elaborate.
First, if the symbol is marked as undefined, then it's considered a weak
symbol by definition. So, to ensure the symbol gets a definition, the
linker must be able to find a strong symbol with the same name. When the
linker encounters such a symbol, it chooses that strong symbol as the
definition to bind all other symbols with. For example, given the programs:

```c
// main.c
int baz=1;
int main() {
	...
}
```

```c
// foo.c
int baz;
p2() {}
```

When the linker encounters `foo` in `foo.c`, it will associate that
undefined entry with the entry for `baz` in `main.c`'s symbol table. This
will ultimately resolve the undefined entries (assuming there are strong
symbols with the same name else where).

If the linker encounters multiple weak symbols with the same name but
nowhere do we provide a strong symbol with the same name, the linker will
choose _any_ of the weak symbols.

Importantly, the linker _will not_ perform type checking. Instead, all it
does is follow these rules blindly:

1. Throw a link error if there are multiple strong symbols with the same
   name.
2. If there is one strong symbol and one or more weak symbols with the same
   name, choose the strong symbol.
3. If there are multiple weak symbols with the same name, choose any of
   them.

Accordingly, we can get some very weird errors if we tried to link two
files that look like the following:

```c
// fileA.c
long int x;
int main() {
	....
}
```

```c
// fileB.c
double x = 3.14;
```

In this case, the linker will choose the `x` defined in `fileB.c` as the
controlling definition to bind all references to. If we don't get any
responses from the operating system (stack overflows, heap overflows,
etc.), our program will compile and run without a hitch. No errors at
compiletime, linktime, or runtime. But, we'll likely see some very strange
results. These are among the worst kinds of bugs because we have no error
messages to work with.

We can avoid this danger by following a set of best practices:

1. If we're going to use a global variable that should only be used within
   its module, declare the variable with `static`.
2. If we need all of our modules to have access to some global variable,
   create a separate header file for globals and define the variable inside
   that header file.
3. If we need all of our modules to have access to some global variable
   that can only be defined in some module (perhaps the output of some
   function in that module), define the variable in a separate header file,
   and mark it with `extern`.
4. Alternatively, we can use the `ifdef` pattern.

The `ifdef` pattern is illustrated with the following examples:

```c
// module.c
#include "global.h"
int f() {
	return g+1;
}
```

```c
// main.c
#define INITIALIZE
#include "global.h"

int main() {
	int x = g * 2;
}
```

```c
// global.h
#ifdef INITIALIZE
	int g = 23;
#else
	extern int g;
#endif
```

When we write `#ifdef INITIALIZE`, we're saying, "If `INITIALIZE` is
defined, use `int g = 23`. Otherwise (the `#else`), use `extern int g`."
This ensures that `g` doesn't get multiple definitions.

### Symbol Relocation

Once the linker has resolved all of the references without error, it
essentially has three separate tables with entries that (1) have no
duplicates and (2) have all the references defined. The final step is to
pull each section from the tables and merge them into a single giant table.

To do so, the linker must adjust some of the addresses for the variables
and functions to ensure everything is sequential. Once it has completed
this alignment process, it outputs the executable, ready for our execution.

To tie this back to our earlier discussions on memory, the linker only
handles the globals, externals, local globals, and statics. Everything else
is handled at runtime (the stack), the operating system (the heap and
external libraries).

<Stack
	data={[
		{ val: "kernel", ant: "invisible" },
		{ val: "stack", ant: "runtime" },
		{ val: "..." },
		{ val: "heap", ant: "malloc at runtime" },
		{ val: "data", ant: "linker" },
		{ val: "bss", ant: "linker" },
		{ val: "init", ant: "linker" },
		{ val: "text", ant: "linker" },
		{ val: "rodata", ant: "linker" },
	]}

	scale={70}
