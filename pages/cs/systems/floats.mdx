# Floating Point Numbers

This section covers notes on floating point numbers. Earlier, we saw that
integers can be easily represented in binary. But what about reals? If we
want to represent reals, we need a method of representing numbers like:

```
{ 3.14, 8.99, 1.01, 1.0, 0.33333 }
```

Question: How do we represent these numbers in binary?

## Fixed Point Binary

One method is __fixed point representation__. The idea behind fixed point
is simple. Given some register that stores a number, some of the register's
bits are used to represent the whole number portion and some are used for
the fractional. For example, given a register of size 14:

```
 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0      1 1 0 0 1 0
|---- whole ----| |-- fractional --|
```

Between these two portions is an imaginary binary point (called the **fixed
point**):

```
 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0  •    1 1 0 0 1 0
|---- whole ----|  |-- fractional --|
```

From there, we can interpret the bits just as we would in decimal:

| -128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   | •   | 1/2 | 1/4 | 1/8 | 1/16 | 1/32 | 1/64 |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 0    | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | •   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0    | 1    | 0    |

To convert to decimal, we just add up the place values:

| -128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   | •   | 1/2 | 1/4 | 1/8 | 1/16 | 1/32 | 1/64 |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 0    | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | •   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0    | 1    | 0    |

```
64 +32 +4 +1/2 +1/4 +1/32
    	 = 100.78125
```

In the examples above, the fixed point representation used ones-complement
to represent negative real numbers. If the system used twos-complement
instead, it would be far more limited in how many numbers it could
represent. Consider a system with 4-bit registers that supports both
floating point numbers _and_ two's complement.

The largest positive number this system can represent is:

| -1  | 1/2 | 1/4 | 1/8 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   |

```
1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.875
```

The smallest positive number:

| -1  | 1/2 | 1/4 | 1/8 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   |

```
0 + 0 + 0 + 1/8 = 0.125 = 0.125
```

The smallest negative number:

| -1  | 1/2 | 1/4 | 1/8 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |

```
-1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = -1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 = -0.125
```

and the largest negative number:

| -1  | 1/2 | 1/4 | 1/8 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

```
-1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = -1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = -1
```

To visualize this range:

```
-1                 0        0.875
|------------------|----------|
```

This is a very limited range. That said, fixed-point binary is extremely
fast. That speed is why fixed-point binary is still used in systems where
time efficiency takes precedence over accuracy:

- digital signal processing,
- graphics processing,
- finance (as we'll see later, rounding in floating point is difficult
  enough to cause legal liability),
- JPEG compression algorithms,
- electricity meters (fixed-point binary processors are much cheaper to
  produce, and accuracy issues with electricity meters can be resolved via
  physics — a topic outside this article's scope).

In all of these systems, performance is far more important than accuracy.
These systems handle tasks that we want done _asap_, accurate or otherwise.

Importantly, for any given binary representation of real numbers, there are
some numbers we can never accurately represent. For example, the number
${\frac{1}{10}.}$ We can easily represent this in decimal (0.1), because
the base in decimal is 10. However, because the base in binary is 2, we
cannot logically add up powers of two to a power of 10. This isn't some
limitation with processors. It's just a mathematical fact. The number
${\frac{1}{3}}$ cannot be accurately represented in decimal or binary, but
it can easily be presented in ternary: 0.1.

## Floating Point Binary

Outside of the applications listed previously, most systems use **floating
point representation** for real numbers. Floating point representations are
colloquially called _floats_.

First, floats are based on standard scientific notation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	2.99 \times 10^{8} &= 299~000~000 \\
	1.4 \times 10^{-4} &= 0.00014 \\
	5.2 \times 10^{11} &= 520~000~000~000
\end{aligned}
$$

Just as a refresher, we can expand scientific numbers by shifting
("floating") the dot (decimal point) to the right 𝑛 places (or left for
-𝑛), where 𝑛 is the exponent's value:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	2.99 \times 10^{8} \\
	&29.9~~~\text{1 place} \\
	&299.0~~~\text{2 places} \\
	&2~990.0~~~\text{3 places} \\
	&29~900.0~~~\text{4 places} \\
	&299~000.0~~~\text{5 places} \\
	&2~990~000.0~~~\text{6 places} \\
	&29~900~000.0~~~\text{7 places} \\
	&299~000~000.0~~~\text{8 places} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
	1.4 \times 10^{-4} \\
	&0.14~~~\text{1 place} \\
	&0.014~~~\text{2 places} \\
	&0.0014~~~\text{3 places} \\
	&0.00014~~~\text{4 places} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Scientific notation has the form:

$$
	m \times 10^{n}
$$

We call ${n}$ the __exponent__, and ${m}$ the __mantissa__ (or
__significand__). At this point, we can state the following proposition:

> __proposition.__ Given a representation of the form ${m \times 10^n,}$ the
> more digits ${n}$ comprises, the more _precise_ ${m \times 10^n}$ is.

> __proposition.__ Given a representation of the form ${m \times 10^n,}$ the
> more digits ${m}$ comprises, the more _accurate_ ${m \times 10^n}$ is.

A quick refresher of accuracy versus precision:

	width={"60"}
/>

For example, if the exponent can only comprise 2 digits, the most we can
float the dot is 99 places.

These basic ideas can be applied on processors. Say we were designing a
16-bit processor:

```
□□□□ □□□□ □□□□ □□□□
```

We want to represent real numbers as well, so we make the following
decision: the 10 bits to the left will represent the mantissa `M`, and the
6 bits to the right will represent the exponent `E`:

```
 □□□□ □□□□ □□      □□□□□□
|----- M ----|  |--- E ---|
```

At the same time, we want to use twos-compliment for both portions (we'll
see why in a moment). So, we reserve the leftmost bit in both portions for
the sign bit:

```
 ■□□□ □□□□ □□      ■□□□□□
|----- M ----|  |--- E ---|
```

Now, this is where we part ways with floating point. We place the imaginary
binary point immediately to the right of the sign bit:

```
 ■•□□□ □□□□ □□      ■□□□□□
|-•---- M ----|  |--- E ---|
```

The sign bit, then, is the left-most bit in the register. Now, let's say we
the bits are initialized as follows:

```
 0•110 1000 00      000011
|-•---- M ----|  |--- E ---|
```

Because the sign bit is `0`, we can conclude that the mantissa is a
positive number. If the sign bit were instead `1`:

```
 1•110 1000 00      000011
|-•---- M ----|  |--- E ---|
```

we would have a negative number. This is where we see the benefit of using
two's complement for the exponent. If the leftmost bit is `0`, then the
exponent is positive:

```
 0•110 1000 00      000011
|-•---- M ----|  |--- E ---|
```

This tells us that the dot should be floated to the right. To conver the
number to decimal, we first convert the exponent to decimal. In the example
above, the exponent is `000011`:

| -32 | 16  |  8  |  4  |  2  |  1  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  |

This yields:

```
0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3
```

This tells us that we have:

$$
	\texttt{M} \times 2^3
$$

In turn, this tells us that the imaginary point should float to the right
by 3 places:

```
  0•110 1000 00      000011    (0 float)
  01•10 1000 00      000011    (1 float)
  011•0 1000 00      000011    (2 floats)
  0110• 1000 00      000011    (3 floats)
 |----- M -----|  |----E----|
```

Trailing zeroes on the righthand side are insignificant. So, we can clean
up:

```
0110•1
```

All we have to do next is interpret this as a _fixed point_ binary number,
but with a slight twist. We must remember whether the leftmost bit in the
original binary number was a `1` or `0`. If it was `0`, then the decimal
represented by the binary digit immediately after the dot must be positive.
If it was a `1`, then the decimal must be negative. In this example, the
leftmost bit was a `0`, so the decimal must be positive:

|  4  |  2  |  1  |  •  | 0.5 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  1  |  1  |  0  |  •  |  1  |

tallying to decimal, we get:

```
0 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 0.5 = 6.5
```

To see that this approach works for very small numbers, let's consider a
negative exponent:

```
 0•100 0000 00      111110
|-•---- M ----|  |--- E ---|
```

Computing the exponent:

| -32 | 16  |  8  |  4  |  2  |  1  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |

```
-32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 0 = -2
```

So, we must float the dot to the left by two places:

```
  0•100 0000 00        000011    (0 float)
  0•0100 0000 00       000011    (-1 float)
  0•00100 0000 00      000011    (-2 floats)
 |----- M -------|  |----E----|
```

Chopping off the insiginifcant bits, we get:

```
0•001
```

|  1  |  •  | 1/2 | 1/4 | 1/8 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  0  |  •  |  0  |  0  |  1  |

```
0 + 0 + 0 + 1/8 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0.125 = 0.125
```

The method works for negatives as well:

```
 1•110 1000 00      000011
|-•---- M ----|  |--- E ---|
```

Once more, we convert the exponent:

| -32 | 16  |  8  |  4  |  2  |  1  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  |

The conversion yields:

```
0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3
```

So, we must float to the right by 3:

```
 1•110 1000 00      000011    (0 floats)
 11•10 1000 00      000011    (1 float)
 111•0 1000 00      000011    (2 floats)
 1110• 1000 00      000011    (3 floats)
|----- M -----|  |--- E ---|
```

Cleaning up:

```
1110•1
```

Because the leftmost bit is `1`, we have:

| -8  |  4  |  2  |  1  | 1/2 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |

which yields:

```
-8 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 0.5 = -1.5
```

Finally, a very small negative number:

```
 1•100 0000 00      111110
|-•---- M ----|  |--- E ---|
```

Converting the exponent:

| -32 | 16  |  8  |  4  |  2  |  1  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |

```
-32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 0 = -2
```

Go back to the mantissa, and float to the left by 2:

```
 1•100 0000 00        111110   (0 floats)
 0•1100 0000 00       111110   (1 float)
 0•01100 0000 00      111110   (2 floats)
|------ M ------|  |--- E ---|
```

Cleaning up:

```
0•0011
```

Now, to convert this number to decimal, we must remember that the leftmost
bit in the original number was a `1` (recall our earlier rule about
remembering the leftmost bit of the original number):

|  1  |  •  | 1/2 | -1/4 | 1/8 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :-: |
|  0  |  •  |  0  |  1   |  1  |

```
0 + 0 + (-0.25) + 0.125 = -0.125
```

## Precision vs. Accuracy

Recall our earlier discussion on precision and accuracy. When it comes
representing numbers, the word _precision_ refers to the number of bits
used to represent a number. _Accuracy_ refers to how close that
representation is to the true number.

For example, consider the real number 0.125 in decimal. With a binary
system, we can represent this number both _precisely_ and _accurately_:

|  1  |  •  | 0.5 | 0.25 | 0.125 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :---: |
|  0  |  •  |  0  |  0   |   1   |

The real number 0.1, however, cannot be represented with complete
precision:

|  1  |  •  | 0.5 | 0.25 | 0.125 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :---: |
|  0  |  •  |  0  |  0   |   1   |

This gives us 0.125. If we had more bits for the exponent, we can gain more
precision:

| Max Exponent Bits |  1  |  •  | 0.5 | 0.25 | 0.125 | 0.0625 | 0.03125 | 0.015625 | 0.0078125 | 0.00390625 | Decimal    |
| :---------------: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :---: | :----: | :-----: | :------: | :-------: | :--------: | ---------- |
|         4         |  0  |  •  |  0  |  0   |   1   |   0    |         |          |           |            | 0.125      |
|         6         |  0  |  •  |  0  |  0   |   0   |   1    |    1    |    0     |           |            | 0.09375    |
|         8         |  0  |  •  |  0  |  0   |   0   |   1    |    1    |    0     |     0     |     1      | 0.09765625 |

With floats, the more bits we have in the mantissa, the more precise our
represented number is. Precision is good, so why don't we just give more
bits for the mantissa? It's financially expensive. To have more bits, we
need a larger register, and to have larger registers, we need more cash to
buy the materials. Because of this hurdle, early processors varied widely
in how many bits they designated for the mantissa. This led to widespread
incompatibility. In turn, this led to a chaotic world of computing —
machines couldn't communicate with one another because of all the different
specifications.

To see how problematic this is, consider the differences in floating-point
representation for different mantissa sizes:

Importantly, with a register size of 8, there are only ${2^8 = 256}$
possible bit patterns. If the system doesn't support real number
representation, then only 256 unique values can be represented. In the
section on normalization, we'll see that if a system _does_ support real
number representation, that range is even smaller.

The more bits we give to the mantissa, the more precise our representations
are. But more bits for the mantissa means less bits for the exponent. And
the less bits we give the exponent, the less accurate our representation
is. This is a tough tradeoff. If we want more precision, we'll have to give
up some accuracy. If we want more accuracy, we'll have to give up some
precision.

### Accumulating Errors

Because of limitations in floating point arithmetic, many computations that
appear benign and straightforward can lead to very strange results.
Consider the following computation in JavaScript:

```javascript
let x = 0.1;
console.log(x);
x += 0.2;
console.log(x);
x -= 0.2;
console.log(x);
```

```bash
0.1
0.30000000000000004
0.10000000000000003
```

For some applications, these errors are insignificant. However, they can
very quickly become significant:

```javascript
let x = 0.1;
console.log(x);
x += 0.2;
console.log(x);
x -= 0.2;
console.log(x);
x *= 1e17;
console.log(x);
```

```bash
0.1
0.30000000000000004
0.10000000000000003
10000000000000004
```

Of course, such large computations arguably should not be done in
JavaScript. The language was never designed for intensive numeric
computations. Best to use Julia or Matlab for such tasks. Nevertheless,
those languages aren't immune either — they're just better at handling (and
in many cases, hiding) these errors.

### Tips for Handling Floating Point Arithmetic

The following are some helpful guidelines in working with floating point
numbers.

**Add numbers of similar small magnitude before adding larger magnitude
numbers.** This tip comes directly from our previous discussion. The
further away two floating point numbers, the larger the gap, and the larger
the gap, the more likely we are to lose precision. For example, consider
the output of the following code:

```javascript
let x = 0.1;
let y = 0.09;
console.log(x);
console.log(y);
x += 0.2;
y += 0.21;
console.log(x);
console.log(y);
```

```bash
0.1
0.09
0.30000000000000004
0.3
```

Above, we see that adding `0.09 + 0.21` yields a more accurate result that
simply adding `0.1 + 0.2`. This is because `0.09` and `0.21` are closer in
magnitude than `0.1` and `0.2`.

__Compute the Fractionals as Integers, then Convert to Floats.__ This is a
fairly straightforward tip. Computer systems handle integers better than
they do floats. Accordingly, if we know that certain computations will
always be performed with same-magnitude floats, we can separate those
computations, perform them as integers, then return the result as a float.
For example, consider the following code:

```javascript
let x = 9.999;
let y = 9.998;
let z = x - y;
console.log(z);
```

```bash
0.0010000000000012221
```

We can rewrite this computation as:

```javascript
let x = 9.999;
let y = 9.998;
let z = (x * 1000 - y * 1000) / 1000;
console.log(z);
```

```bash
0.001
```

**Multiplying Tiny Numbers Against Extremely Large Numbers is Almost Always
a Bad Idea.** When multiplying and dividing floats, we _always_ want to
keep the operands as close to each other as possible. Consider the
following computation:

```javascript
let x = (1 / 77770) * (1 / 11110) * (99990 * 199990 * 22220);
console.log(x);
```

```bash
514259.99999999994;
```

This is a good example of how bad overflow and underflow can be. The result
is way, way off. We should be seeing repeating decimals:

```
51402.857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142...
```

To prevent this disaster, we want to rearrange how the computation is
performed:

```javascript
let x = (99990 / 77770) * (22220 / 11110) * 19990;
console.log(x);
```

```bash
51402.857142857145
```

__Turn off the Code Formatter and Linter.__ Code formatters (e.g.,
Prettier) and linters often take liberties in inserting or removing
parentheses from expressions. Some of these modifications are _bad_, not so
much because the developers don't consider floating point sensitivity, but
because they can't possibly predict every possible way to write an
expression. Accordingly, if we want to ensure a particular expression is
always written as is, we must ensure that the code formatter or linter
doesn't go anywhere near such code.

## IEEE-754

As mentioned earlier, the widespread variations in floating specifications
led to a wild west of computer systems. To establish order, IEEE (the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) created the **IEEE-754
standard**. IEEE is an organization that creates many standards, and the
754 denotes that the standard was the 754th standard created by IEEE.

Under IEEE-754, processor manufacturers have two options if they want to be
IEEE-754 compliant:

1. The mantissa comprises 24 bits (called __single precision__).
2. The mantissa comprises 53 bits (called __double precision__).
