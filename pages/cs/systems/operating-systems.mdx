# Operating Systems
_This note presents an overview of machines._

## Background
- A CPU is a chip that fetches instructions from memory and executes them.
	- The instructions belong to some program ${P.}$
- Memory consists of chips closest to the CPU and farthest from the CPU:
	1. __Registers__
		- Storage on the CPU for single-bits.
	3. __Cache__
		- ${n}$-byte storages closer to the CPU. 
	5. __RAM__
		- All contents when current is lost.
		- RAM consists of partitions:
			1. An _program_ partition (where instructions are stored).
				- E.g., Photoshop's instruction to turn `nyc.png` into grayscale.
			2. A _data_ partition (where substantive data is stored).
				- E.g., `nyc.png`.
	6. __Disk__
		- Contents remain despite loss of current.
	7. __Cloud__
		- Databases/storages/servers on remote machines.
		- Dependent on current and network connection.
		- Slowest of all memory devices. 
- The list above is called the _memory hierarchy_ or _memory ladder_.
- ~observations~. 
	- Instructions closer to the CPU execute faster than instructions further from the CPU (less distance to travel).
	- The closer a memory device is to the CPU, the more expensive the device is to manufacture.
	- The more expensive a device is to manufacture, the less storage.
- Some programs are so large (e.g., Google Chrome) that they can't fit into RAM.
	- Fix: Store the instructions in _disk_.
	- Effect: The program now runs slower because of how far its instructions are from the CPU.
	- Fix: Store the instructions in disk, and when they're scheduled to execute, copy the instructions into RAM. 
		- This pattern extends to the other rungs of the memory ladder.
		- Disk ${\nc}$ RAM ${\nc}$ Cache ${\nc}$ Registers
## Problem
- Suppose a system's RAM can only hold 50 programs, while its disk can hold 1000 programs.
- How do we determine which 50 programs to load into RAM out of the 1000?
- We could use a probabilistic approach: Which of the 50 programs are most likely to be called?
	- ~problem~: We have no easy way of making this determination. _Any_ of the 1000 programs could be called at _any_ time.
