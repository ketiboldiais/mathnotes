# Redis
_Notes on Redis._

## Overview
Redis is a key-value store. It's not necessarily a database because it lacks traditional notions of data persistence. However, because it often looks, walks, and quacks like a database, we'll treat it as such. That said, it's a peculiar database:

1. Redis stores via RAM. If the host system crashes or shuts down, Redis-stored data dissipates.
2. Because of point ${\px{1},}$ Redis is not used for persistent storage.
3. Because of point ${\px{1},}$ Redis _much faster_ at reading and writing than traditional databases.

From ${\px{1}-\px{3},}$ Redis is ideal for data with the following properties:

1. Low cost of loss (i.e., does not require absolute persistence),
2. frequently changing,
3. frequent read/writes, or
4. take a very long time to compute.

~example~. Verification codes and JSON web tokens often have short lifespans. Storing them in traditional databases would require frequent database transactions for management.

~example~. Group invitations on a chatting application usually have short enough lifespans that storing them in a database would be troublesome.

## Architecture
For most applications, Redis sits in front of a database:

$$
\sd{\tx{client}} \iff 
\sd{\tx{server}} \iff
\sd{\tx{Redis}} \iff
\sd{\tx{database}}
$$

## Commands
| Command        | Semantic                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| `redis-server` | Starts a Redis server      |
| `redis-cli`    | Starts a Redis CLI session |
| `quit`         | Ends the CLI session       |

### Store a Key-value Pair
~~~terminal
$ SET name john
OK
$ GET name
"john"
~~~
By default, all values in Redis are stored as strings.

### Delete a Key
~~~terminal
$ DEL name
(nil)
~~~

### Check if a Key Exists
~~~terminal
$ EXISTS name
(integer) 0
~~~

### Delete Everything in Store
~~~terminal
$ flushall
OK
$ KEYS *
(empty array)
~~~

### Expiration
The `ttl` command tells us how long the key will last. A value of `-1` means that the key has no expiration.
~~~terminal
$ SET name sam
OK
$ ttl name
(integer) -1
~~~
We can set expirations with the `expire` command. Below, the `name` key is set to expire in 10 seconds.
~~~terminal
$ expire name 10
(integer) 1
~~~
Alternatively:
~~~terminal
$ setex name 10 sam
OK
~~~

### Storing Arrays
To store an array. Below, the line[1] makes a list called `tokens`, containing the value `01a94fa`. To get this list, we use the `lrange` command, followed by the starting index and the ending index. In this case, `0 -1` corresponds to obtaining every item in the list `tokens`.
~~~terminal
$ lpush tokens 01a94fa
(integer) 1
$ lrange tokens 0 -1
1) 01a94fa
~~~
The command `lpush` will insert an element at the leftside of the array, and `rpush` will insert an element at the rightside of the array.

#### Removing an Element
To remove an element from an array use either `lpop` (remove from the leftside) or `rpop` (remove from the rightside).
~~~terminal
$ lpop tokens
01a94fa
~~~

### Storing Sets 
Sets are stores with entirely unique values. To store a set:
~~~terminal
$ sadd tokens ajc92a0
(integer) 1
~~~
To read the values, we use `smembers`:
~~~terminal
$ smembers tokens
1) ajc92a0
~~~

### Storing Hashes
For Redis, a hash is a set of key-value pairs. To store hashes, we prefix commands with an `h`.
~~~terminal
$ hset jim name james
$ hset jim age 28
(integer) 1
$ hget jim name
jimmy
$ hgetall jim
1) name
2) james
3) age
4) 28
~~~
This corresponds to an object that looks like:
~~~typescript
jim = { name: "jimmy", age: 26 }
~~~
