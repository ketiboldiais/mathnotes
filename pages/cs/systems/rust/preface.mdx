# The Rust Programming Language

This chapter provides broad level overview of the Rust programming
language. Most of the materials in this volume, _Systems_, uses C followed
by C++. However, because Rust is just about as fast as these languages
while also providing _safety_, some examples and implementations adopt a
_Rustacean_ approach. Accordingly, a broad overview of the language is in
order.

## What Is Rust?

It's a programming language. More specifically, a modern _systems
programming language_ — a language for building computer systems. Web
servers, operating systems, security infrastructures, these are all
examples of computer systems that require safety and performance.

Undoubtedly, the vast majority of these systems are built with C or C++. C,
for example, does not just reign supreme in embedded systems, it's quite
literally entrenched — or more aptly, _embedded_ — in the field. C++ is
king in high-frequency trading systems and computer graphics.

So if the existing languages already have a monopoly in their respective
fields, why does Rust exist at all?
