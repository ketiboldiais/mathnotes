On a computer, an integer value can mean one of two things:

1. An actual data value, or
2. A memory address

By a _memory address_, we mean some integer value that names a _byte_ in
memory. For example, in the diagram below, each cell is 1 byte of memory.
The left column is the address (a hexadecimal number), and the right column
consists of 8 bits.

<Mem
	data={[
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
	]}
	cellWidth={60}
	width={250}
	scale={50}
/>

Notice that each of the addresses increments by one. If were to store a
`char` value ‚Äî a data type that consumes 1 byte of memory ‚Äî it would occupy
exactly one of these cells. For example, the number 5 in eight bits is
`0000 0101`. If we wrote:

```c
char x = 5;
```

we would have:

<Mem
	data={[
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		{ val: "0000 0101", id: "x" },
	]}
	cellWidth={60}
	width={300}
	scale={40}
/>

What if we wrote:

```c
int x = 56;
```

In this case, for a program compiled with a 64-bit compiler, we would have:

<Mem
	data={[
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		"0000 0000",
		{ val: "0000 0000", className: "vald" },
		{ val: "0000 0000", className: "vald" },
		{ val: "0000 0000", className: "vald" },
		{ val: "0011 1000", id: "x", className: "vald" },
	]}
	cellWidth={60}
	width={300}
	scale={40}
/>

Notice that in the diagram above, the value `56` occupies 4 bytes. This is
because for a 64-bit program, an `int` takes up 4 bytes of memory. This
leads to an interesting observation:

> _Variable names are just a convenient way ‚Äî human-readable identifiers ‚Äî
> of labelling the contiguous block of bytes composing the data value._

The variable itself maps to the first address in this contiguous block (in
the diagram above, `0x09`). Thus, the notion of a data type serves two
purposes from the computer's perspective:

1. It instructs the computer how much memory should be set aside for the
   value.
2. It instructs the computer how far to _read_ ‚Äî starting from the first
   address mapped to the variable ‚Äî the array of memory blocks to get all
   of the necessary bits for the value.

We distinguish between the two possibilities with **pointers**. Simply put,
a pointer is a variable that stores the address of a location in memory. We
expand this definition with a few additional terms and propositions:

1. Because a pointer is a variable that stores a memory address, we also
   say that a pointer _is_ a memory address.
2. Because the pointer is a variable, the pointer has a memory address of
   its own ‚Äî it's a memory address that stores a memory address. As such,
   there are always two sides to a pointer:
   1. The _address of_ a pointer, and
   2. The _address in_ a pointer.
3. In text, we will refer to the _address of_ a pointer as the pointer's
   **addof**, and the _address in_ a pointer as the pointer's **addin**.
4. The the address a pointer stores is called the pointer's **pointee**.
5. Because the pointee is a memory address, it contains data, whether it's
   our program's data or garbage. In text, we will refer to this data as
   the pointer's **valat** ("_value at_").

## Pointer Declaration: \*ptr = &var

To illustrate, say we wrote the code:

```c
int a = 4;
int b = 6;
int c = 8;
```

We can visualize the result in memory as follows:

<Mem
	data={[
		"...",
		"...",
		"vdots10",
		{ val: 4, id: "a" },
		{ val: 6, id: "b" },
		{ val: 8, id: "c" },
		"vdots10",
		"...",
	]}
	scale={50}
/>

Above, the values 4, 6, and 8 are stored in the addresses `0x0B`, `0x0C`,
and `0x0D` respectively. When we write:

```c
int a = 4;
int b = 6;
int c = 8;
int *p = &a;
```

We get the following:

<Mem
	data={[
		"...",
		"...",
		"vdots10",
		{ val: 4, id: "a" },
		{ val: 6, id: "b" },
		{ val: 8, id: "c" },
		{ val: "0x0B", id: "p" },
		"vdots10",
		"...",
	]}
	scale={60}
	height={300}
	width={450}
/>

Notice what happens here. When we write `&a`, we get `a`'s addof.
Furthermore, `p`'s addin (`0x0B`) is `a`'s addof (`0x0B`). `p`'s addof,
however, does not change (`0x0E`). Let's illustrate further with some C++
code.

### Uninitialized Pointers

Whenever we declare a pointer, it's critical that we initialize them
immediately whenever possible. That is, we really only have two options for
declaration:

1. `int *ùëù = &ùë£`, where ùëù is a pointer variable and ùë£ is an existing
   variable, or
2. `int *ùëù = null`.

If we just write `int *ùëù`, ùëù is effectively a **wild pointer**. The
descriptor _wild_ is fitting: ùëù points to _anywhere_ in memory. We never
want a pointer that stores some random address. With a sufficiently complex
program, it's all too easy to forget that we neglected to initialize the
pointer. When we later dereference ùëù far, far away from when we declared
it, we'll almost certainly be scratching our heads at either (1) a seg
fault, (2) some compiler error, (3) some seemingly random value, or (4)
perhaps worst of all, getting the correct outputs intermittently.

### Null Pointers

Writing:

```c
int *p = NULL;
```

assigns the address `0x0` (the integer 0) as `p`'s addin. This means that
if we attempt to dereference `p`, we are guaranteed to get a seg fault.
This is a better outcome than what we'd get with a wild pointer, because
we, at the very least, get a single outcome everytime.

Because of the assignment of 0x0, we can use the pattern of
_null-pointer-checking_:

```c
if (p == NULL) {
	// handle
}
```

This is a particularly useful construct, as it allows to check for a
variety of situations: whether we've reached the end of a linked list,
whether no value was assigned, whether the user didn't enter a value, and
so on.

## Printing Memory Addresses

We can print a memory address in C++ with the following code:

```c
int main() {
	int a = 4;
	int b = c;
	int c = 8;
	int *p = &a;
	printf("addof(a) = %p \n", &a);
}
```

```bash
addof(a) = 0x7ff7b759dd18
```

Here, we see that `a`'s addof is `0x7ff7b759dd18`. Let's see some more
outputs:

```c
int main() {
	int a = 4;
	int b = 6;
	int c = 8;
	int *p = &a;
	printf("addof(a) = %p \n", &a);
	printf("addof(b) = %p \n", &b);
	printf("addof(c) = %p \n", &c);
	printf("addof(p) = %p \n", &p);
	printf("addin(p) = %p \n", p);
}
```

```bash
addof(a) = 0x7ff7b6112d18
addof(b) = 0x7ff7b6112d14
addof(c) = 0x7ff7b6112d10
addof(p) = 0x7ff7b6112d08
addin(p) = 0x7ff7b6112d18
```

The output conforms to our earlier discussion. `a`'s addof is
`0x7ff7b6112d18`, `p`'s addin is `0x7ff7b6112d18`. and `p`'s addof is
`0x7ff7b6112d18`.

## Dereferencing: \*ptr

Returning to our code example:

```c
int a = 4;
int b = 6;
int c = 8;
int *p = &a;
```

Because `p` stores `a`'s addof, we can access the contents of `a`:

```c
int main() {
	int a = 4;
	int b = 6;
	int c = 8;
	int *p = &a;
	printf("valat(p) = %d \n", *p);
}
```

```bash
valat(p): 4
```

Notice the operator we used. When we write:

```nasm
*p
```

We are really saying:

```nasm
read the contents in addof(a)
```

and because `addof(a) = 0x7ff7b6112d18`, this redues to:

```nasm
read the contents in 0x7ff7b6112d18
```

Setting everything else aside, that's all there really is to pointers. We
use `*` to initialize a pointer, `&` to get an addof, and `*` to get the
valat.

## Indirect Transfering: *ptr1 = *ptr2

Suppose we have the following:

```c
int x = 0;
int y = 1;

int *p = &x;
int *q = &y;

*p = *q
```

Logging the variables' stored values and addresses, we get the following:

<Grid cols={2}>

```bash
Before indirect transfer:
 valat(a) = a = 0
 valat(b) = b = 1
 valat(p1) = *p1 = 0
 valat(p2) = *p2 = 1
After indirect transfer:
 valat(a) = a = 1
 valat(b) = b = 1
 valat(p1) = *p1 = 1
 valat(p2) = *p2 =  1
```

```bash
Before indirect transfer:
 addof(a) = &a = 0x7ff7bfaaecf8
 addof(b) = &b = 0x7ff7bfaaecf4
 addin(p1) = p1 = 0x7ff7bfaaecf8
 addin(p2) = p2 = 0x7ff7bfaaecf4
After indirect transfer:
 addof(a) = &a = 0x7ff7bfaaecf8
 addof(b) = &b = 0x7ff7bfaaecf4
 addin(p1) = p1 = 0x7ff7bfaaecf8
 addin(p2) = p2 =  0x7ff7bfaaecf4
```

</Grid>

Crucially, notice that the addresses haven't changed, but the values stored
in those addresses have. This is a common pattern in C code called
**indirect transferring**.

## Aliases: ptr1 = ptr2

Consider the following code:

```c
int a = 0;
int b = 1;

int *p1 = &a;
int *p2 = &b;

p1 = p2;
```

Logging the addresses for these variables, we get:

```bash
Before aliasing:
 addof(a) = &a = 0x7ff7b3f51cf8
 addof(b) = &b = 0x7ff7b3f51cf4
 addin(p1) = p1 = 0x7ff7b3f51cf8
 addin(p2) = p2 = 0x7ff7b3f51cf4
After aliasing:
 addof(a) = &a = 0x7ff7b3f51cf8
 addof(b) = &b = 0x7ff7b3f51cf4
 addin(p1) = p1 = 0x7ff7b3f51cf4
 addin(p2) = p2 =  0x7ff7b3f51cf4
```

When we wrote `p1 = p2`, the `p1`'s `addin` becomes the same as `p2`'s
addin. In effect, both `p1` and `p2` point to the same location in memory ‚Äî
the location marked as `b`. Because of this result, we say that `p1` and
`p2` are **aliases** of the variable `b`.

## Warning: \*ptr1 = ptr2

When we write the following:

```c
int a = 0;
int b = 1;

int *p1 = &a;
int *p2 = &b;

*p1 = p2;
```

we get a warning. Why? Because we're trying to fit a memory address (some
very large value) into an `int*` variable. For a 64-bit program, that
`int*` variable only covers 8 bytes. Accordingly, we will lose any bits
that cannot fit into the `int*`.

## Warning: ptr = \*ptr

When we write:

```c
int a = 0;
int b = 1;

int *p1 = &a;
int *p2 = &b;

p1 = *p2;
```

we also get a warning. This, however, is arguably far more sinister than
the previous warning. Why? Because (1) we're assigning some `int` value as
the pointer `p1`'s addin, and (2) because an `int` is 4 bytes, it will fit.
However, that address is almost certainly a bogus address.

## malloc, sizeof, & free

In the examples we've covered, we've used memory on the stack. As soon as a
function returns, the stack is cleared, and we lose all the data created
and used within that function.

We can, however, also allocate data from _heap memory_. In C, we can do so
with the _memory-allocate_ function:

$$
	\mm{malloc(ùëÅ)} \implies *ùëù
$$

where ùëÅ is the number of bytes we want, and \*ùëù is the returned value, a
_pointer_ (recall that a pointer is just memory address ‚Äî `malloc()`
returns a heap-memory address).

Because we often do not know how many bytes are needed to store a
particular value, a common pattern in C is to use the `sizeof` operator:

$$
	\mm{sizeof(ùëá)}
$$

where ùëá is a type. A critical fact applies whenever we allocate memory with
`malloc()`:

> If we allocate ùëÅ bytes by writing `malloc(ùëÅ)`, the ùëÅ bytes will remain
> allocated until the ùëÅ bytes are freed.

This means that, if we allocate ùëÅ bytes for usage, those ùëÅ bytes cannot be
re-allocated. This in turn means that if we do not free that memory, our
program will have less available memory for usage. To free the allocated
memory, we use the `free` operator. The syntax:

$$
	\mm{free}(ùëù)
$$

where ùëù is the pointer returned by `malloc()`. To illustrate:

```c
int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
*p = 57;
// some code
// finished using p
free(p);
```

Above, \*ùëù is stores some address in heap memory. That address spans 4
bytes. Why? Because `sizeof(int)` returns 4, and passing that number into
`malloc()` says, "Allocate 4 bytes of heap memory and give me the address
of the first byte". When we then write `*p = 57`, we are storing the value
`57` at the address in heap memory.

#### Dangling Pointers

There's one thing we should keep in mind with `free` operator. After we
write `free(ùëù)`, the pointer `ùëù` actually still stores its addin, say some
address `0x2231`. When `ùëù` is in this state, we say that `ùëù` is a
**dangling pointer**.

Dangling pointers exist because the `free` operator doesn't actually
"delete" or "clear" anything. Instead, it just tells the system: "I'm no
longer using this address `0x2231`, so go ahead and make it available for
others to use." This means that we can _still_ dereference `ùëù`. But,
there's no guarantee that whatever is in that address is what was in there
previously. Instead, it's much more likely that the address now contains
some completely random, garbage value.

#### Double Free

A more common bug with the `free` operator is freeing a pointer twice:

```c
int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
*p = 17;
// some code
// finished using p
free(p);
// some more code
// forgot that p is already freed
free(p);
```

This bug is so common that it's often called the **double free**. Is it
that easy to forget that we've freed a pointer? In some sense, yes.
However, a more common scenario of the double free is the following:

```c
int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
*p = 17;
int *q = p;
free(p);

// this is a double free
free(q);
```

Why is this a double free? Because the pointers `p` and `q` both point to
the same location in memory:

<Mem
	data={[
		{ val: "...", a: "0x9..." },
		{ val: "0x3000", a: "0x9016", id: "q" },
		{ val: "0x3000", a: "0x9000", id: "p" },
		"vdots1",
		"vdots1",
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "17", a: "0x3000", id: "*p,*q" },
	]}
	cellWidth={40}
	scale={50}
/>

If when we write `free(p)`, we free the address `0x3000`, and when we write
`free(q)`, we free it again.

Why is this such a big deal? Because a double free effectively frees a
memory address that is likely in use by another part of our program or some
other entity.

#### Post-free Nullification

Because of the danger, a common pattern in C is the _post-free
nullification_:

```c
int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
*p = 57;
// some code
// finished using p
free(p);
p = null;
```

Like the _post-declaration-nullification_ pattern, this pattern ensures
that any attempt to dereference or free a freed pointer will result in a
seg fault.

## Copies: var = var

As a precursor to the next section, when we write:

```c
int a = 0;
int b = a;
```

we create a _copy_ of the variable `a`.

## References: &var = var

Consider this code's output:

```c
int main() {
	int a = 8;
	int &b = a;
	printf("a = %d\n", a);
	printf("b = %d\n", b);

	b = a + 2;

	printf("a = %d\n", a);
	printf("b = %d\n", b);
}
```

```bash
a = 8
b = 8
a = 10
b = 10
```

We're seeing the output above because `&b` is a _reference_ to `a`. If we
print the addresses for both variables:

```c
int main() {
	int a = 8;
	int &b = a;
	printf("addof(a) = %p\n", &a);
	printf("addof(b) = %p\n", &b);
}
```

```bash
addof(a) = 0x7ff7bc7acd18
addof(b) = 0x7ff7bc7acd18
```

we see that they're the same. This is very different from the use of a
pointer. Compare the outputs if we had instead declared `b` as a pointer:

<Grid cols={2} rows={2}>

```c
int main() {
	int a = 8;
	int &b = a;
	printf("addof(a) = %p\n", &a);
	printf("addof(b) = %p\n", &b);
}
```

```c
int main() {
	int a = 8;
	int *b = &a;
	printf("addof(a) = %p\n", &a);
	printf("addof(b) = %p\n", &b);
}
```

```bash
addof(a) = 0x7ff7bc7acd18
addof(b) = 0x7ff7bc7acd18
```

```bash
addof(a) = 0x7ff7ba6c5d18
addof(b) = 0x7ff7ba6c5d10
```

</Grid>

Under the hood, the operations of references and pointers do not appear
that different. When we write `&b`, we are asking for `b`'s addof. Suppose
`b`'s addof is `0x3def`. When we write `int &b = a`, we're effectively
writing:

```nasm
0x3def = a
```

Since variable names are just human-readable identifiers for memory
addresses, this is akin to saying:

> The address `0x3def` stores the address called `a`.

Again, not that different from a pointer at a low level. At a higher level,
however, things are different. Once we write `&b = a`, the address `0x3def`
essentially no longer exits. Instead, whenever we refer to the address
`0x3def` ‚Äî which we've called `b` ‚Äî we will ultimately refer to the address
called `a`. This is change in the usual mechanics, and it should be viewed
as a different concept.

As a _pointer_, `b` has its own, unique address, different from `a`. But as
a _reference_, `b` has no life of its own ‚Äî it's just another name for the
address called `a`. Whatever changes we make on `a`, it'll show up for `b`,
and whatever changes we make on `b`, it'll show up for `a`. Put bluntly,
`b` is to `a` what Superman is to Clark Kent. Damage Superman and you
damage Clark Kent, damage Clark Kent and you damage Superman. They're the
same person.

This demonstrates the key difference between pointers and references: With
pointers, we can perform arithmetic operations, since the address variable
has a pointee it can use as a starting point. With references, the address
variable has no such starting point ‚Äî it _is_ the starting point.

## Pass-by-reference v. Pass-by-value

Suppose we create a variable `int a = 1`. What's the difference between
writing `int b = a` and `int &b = a`? Well, we can test:

<Grid cols={2} rows={2}>

```c
int main() {
	int a = 8;
	int b = a;

	printf("addof(a) = %p\n", &a);
	printf("addof(b) = %p\n", &b);

	a = a + 2;
	b = b + 1;

	printf("valat(a) = %d\n", a);
	printf("valta(b) = %d\n", b);
}
```

```c
int main() {
	int a = 8;
	int &b = a;

	printf("addof(a) = %p\n", &a);
	printf("addof(b) = %p\n", &b);

	a = a + 2;
	b = b + 1;

	printf("valat(a) = %d\n", a);
	printf("valat(b) = %d\n", b);
}
```

```bash
addof(a) = 0x7ff7bd9b6d18
addof(b) = 0x7ff7bd9b6d14
valat(a) = 10
valat(b) = 9
```

```bash
addof(a) = 0x7ff7b12b9d18
addof(b) = 0x7ff7b12b9d18
valat(a) = 11
valta(b) = 11
```

</Grid>

When we write `int b = a`, we're effectively creating a _copy_ of the value
stored in `a`, and saving that copy in the memory address called `b`. This
is apparent given the fact that (1) both `a` and `b` have different
addresses, and (2) the changes we make to `b` are independent of the
changes we make to `a`, and vice versa.

The difference between these two constructs leads to a distinction between
**pass by reference** and **pass by value**. To illustrate, look at the
output of these two functions:

<Grid cols={2} rows={2}>

```c
void halve_by_reference(int *number) {
	*number = (*number) / 2;
};

int main() {
	int a = 8;
	printf("a = %d\n", a);
	halve_by_reference(&a);
	printf("a = %d\n", a);
}
```

```c
void halve_by_value(int number) {
	number = number / 2;
}

int main() {
	int a = 8;
	printf("a = %d\n", a);
	halve_by_value(a);
	printf("a = %d\n", a);
}
```

```bash
a = 8
a = 4
```

```bash
a = 8
a = 8
```

</Grid>

In the function `halve_by_reference()`, the parameter is a memory address
containing an `int`. In the function `halve_by_value()`, the parameter is a
value `int`. There are two functions that operate very differently. To see
why, let's compare how they affect memory.

When the function `main()` is executed, we ultimately end up with something
that looks like:

<Mem
	data={[
		"...",
		"...",
		"vdots25",
		{ val: 8, id: "a" },
		{ val: "...", id: "<-sp" },
	]}
	scale={20}
/>

Above, there's a special pointer called the _stack pointer_. This pointer
keeps track of the variables and data values used in the program. Setting
aside the `printf` calls, when we get to the call `halve_by_reference()`, a
"bookmark" called a _return address_ is created for `main()`, and the
arguments for `halve_by_reference()` are set up:

<Mem
	data={[
		"...",
		"...",
		"vdots25",
		{ val: 8, id: "a" },
		{ val: "return address" },
		"vdots25",
		{ val: 8, id: "number" },
		{ val: "...", id: "<-sp" },
	]}
	scale={40}
	cellWidth={120}
	width={500}
/>

It then performs the computation (in this case `number = number / 2`):

<Mem
	data={[
		"...",
		"...",
		"vdots25",
		{ val: 8, id: "a" },
		{ val: "return address" },
		"vdots25",
		{ val: 4, id: "number" },
		{ val: "...", id: "<-sp" },
	]}
	scale={40}
	cellWidth={120}
	width={500}
/>

And once there no further instructions to execute, it _returns_ to the
bookmark it placed:

<Mem
	data={[
		"...",
		"...",
		"vdots25",
		{ val: 8, id: "a" },
		{ val: "...", id: "<-sp" },
		"vdots25",
		{ val: 4, id: "number" },
	]}
	scale={40}
	cellWidth={120}
	width={500}
/>

Importantly, everything after the stack pointer is essentially gone ‚Äî it no
longer exists. There's no data available that would allow us to go back to
the values in those memory addresses. Thus, when we print the value of `a`
with `printf()`, we get back the value of `a`, which is `8`.

Now, contrast this with the use of a reference. When the stack pointer sets
up the function call, the argument passed is not a value, but the _address_
of a value:

<Mem
	data={[
		"...",
		"...",
		"vdots25",
		{ val: 8, id: "a" },
		{ val: "return address" },
		"vdots25",
		{ val: "0x1A", id: "number" },
		{ val: "...", id: "<-sp" },
	]}
	scale={40}
	cellWidth={120}
	width={500}
/>

When we perform the computation (`*number = *number/2`), we are saying,
"The value stored at the address called `number` is the current value
divided by two." This results in:

<Mem
	data={[
		"...",
		"...",
		"vdots25",
		{ val: 4, id: "a" },
		{ val: "return address" },
		"vdots25",
		{ val: "0x1A", id: "number" },
		{ val: "...", id: "<-sp" },
	]}
	scale={40}
	cellWidth={120}
	width={500}
/>

Notice how the value in the address called `a` is now `4`. When the stack
pointer goes back to where it left off and we call `printf()`, we get the
value of `a` as expected ‚Äî `4`.

<Mem
	data={[
		"...",
		"...",
		"vdots25",
		{ val: 4, id: "a" },
		{ val: "...", id: "<-sp" },
		"vdots25",
		{ val: "0x1A", id: "number" },
	]}
	scale={40}
	cellWidth={120}
	width={500}
/>

This demonstrates the difference between the two functions.
`halve_by_reference` is a _pass-by-reference function_, while
`halve_by_value` is a _pass-by-value_ function. In a _pass-by-value_
function, the function's parameters (in our example, `number`) are _copies_
of the arguments passed. But in a _pass-by-reference_ function, the
function's parameters are references of the arguments passed ‚Äî the
originals. These memory savings are particularly valuable when the
arguments passed are potentially massive objects ‚Äî a record of users or
extremely large numbers.

This discussion leads to another observation: pass-by-reference functions
are more memory-efficient than pass-by-value functions, since we avoid the
need to make copies. The downside, however, is that pass-by-reference
functions can make programs difficult to reason about. If we're passing a
value through hundreds of functions, each modifying that value, we can
easily lose track of what's happening to the value and where. This can lead
to functions that are harder to debug, as bugs might originate in either
(1) the function itself, (2) the arguments passed to the function ‚Äî
requiring us to trace to earlier functions, or (3) both.

### Pass-by-object-reference

As an aside, some languages use another form of indirection called
**pass-by-object**. Consider the following code's output:

```c
struct Point {
	int x;
	int y;
};

void zero1(Point &obj1) {
	obj1 = (Point) {.x = 0, .y = 0};
}

void zero2(Point obj2) {
	obj2 = (Point) {.x = 0, .y = 0};
}

int main() {
	Point a = {.x = 1, .y = 1};
	Point b = {.x = 5, .y = 5};

	printf("a = {x: %d, y: %d}\n", a.x, a.y);
	printf("b = {x: %d, y: %d}\n", b.x, b.y);

	zero1(a);
	zero2(b);

	printf("a = {x: %d, y: %d}\n", a.x, a.y);
	printf("b = {x: %d, y: %d}\n", b.x, b.y);
	return 0;
}
```

```bash
a = {x: 1, y: 1}
b = {x: 5, y: 5}
a = {x: 0, y: 0}
b = {x: 5, y: 5}
```

Examining the output, we see that `Point a` is zeroed, but `Point b` is
not. This is an example of pass-by-object-reference. This is not all that
difference from passing by reference. The only difference is, we're passing
a reference to some object ‚Äî a container ‚Äî rather than a reference to some
primitive.

We point this out because it's a semantic found in many popular languages,
particularly Java, C#, and JavaScript. Those languages are all inherently
pass-by-value, but the value passed is a _reference_.

## Why is the Asterisk Used for Declaration and Dereference?

The two use cases for `*` is seen by some as a poor decision in language
design. Others see it as a reasonable choice. Regardless of which side of
the fence we fall on, the decision was intentional, not an accident.

The idea behind the decision is _declaration follows use_, per Dennis
Ritchie's (one of C's creators) comments. To understand this idea, we just
need a little more information about pointers.

### Pointer Types

In C/C++, all pointers have types. This means that, when we write:

```c
int a = 4;
double *p;
```

the pointer `p` _cannot_ store `a`'s addof. We can see that this is the
case when we try to compile the following:

```c
int main() {
	int a = 4;
	double *p = &a;
}
```

```bash
error:
	cannot initialize a variable
	of type 'double *' with
	an rvalue of type 'int *'

					double *p = &a;
									^   ~~
	1 error generated.
```

The error above tells us that variable of type `double *` can't be
initialized with an _rvalue_ (_right-hand value_) of type `int *`. This is
because data types ultimately tell the process how far along memory it
should read for a value.

For example, say we had a 64-bit program. The datatype `double` indicates
that the data stored spans 8 bytes. So, the processor will read 8 addresses
total, starting from the first. The datatype `int`, however, might only
spans 4 bytes. This means that, _if_ we could use a `double` to point to an
`int`, the processor would read 4 bytes _more_ than necessary. We do not
want that to happen, because we have no idea what's inside the the four
additional bytes.

What if it was the other way around? For example, consider the following:

```c
int main() {
	double a = 4.2;
	int *p = &a;
}
```

```bash
error:
	cannot initialize a variable of
	type 'int *' with an rvalue of
	type 'double *'

					int *p = &a;
							^   ~~
	1 error generated.
```

We get the same kind of error. Why? Because now we're _under_ the necessary
amount. The `double` type (on a 64-bit program) needs 8 bytes, but our
pointer type says, "Read 4 bytes". This means that we're not going to get
all of the necessary bits that make up our value `4.2`. Given that floating
point numbers are not direct representations of a fractional number
(they're encodings), the value from dereferencing `p` would be nonsensical.

To get a sense of these data types visually (for a 64-bit program), each
block below equals 1 byte:

<table style={{ width: "90%" }} className="hagoTable">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th style={{ width: "10%" }}>Data Type</th>
			<th>Visual</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>`char`</td>
			<td>
				<StaticArray data={[" "]} scale={15} cheight={1} />
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`short`</td>
			<td>
				<StaticArray data={[" ", " "]} scale={19} cheight={0.7} />
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`int`</td>
			<td>
				<StaticArray
					data={[" ", " ", " ", " "]}
					scale={30}
					cheight={0.4}
				/>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`long`</td>
			<td>
				<StaticArray
					data={[" ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "]}
					scale={50}
					cheight={0.3}
				/>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`float`</td>
			<td>
				<StaticArray
					data={[" ", " ", " ", " "]}
					scale={30}
					cheight={0.4}
				/>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>`double`</td>
			<td>
				<StaticArray
					data={[" ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "]}
					scale={50}
					cheight={0.3}
				/>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

So, going back to the notion of _declaration follows use_. The idea is,
when we write:

```c
int n;
```

we can expect that `n` will always be an `int` when used within scope. This
means that, when we write:

```c
int *p;
```

if we want to get a value `int`, we have to write `*p`. Why? Because `p`
itself doesn't hold an `int`, it holds a memory address. The expression
that holds the `int` is `*p`. To clarify a little further, suppose the way
to declare a pointer in C was not `*`, to write out the word
`getValueAt_ùê¥`, where ùê¥ is the pointer variable. Using this hypothetical
syntax, we get:

```c
int getValueAt_p
```

things look a little more obvious ‚Äî it's just another variable name. If we
want to get an `int`, we write `getValueAt_p`. At this point, we can likely
see why there are critics. When we write:

```c
int a = 4;
int *p = &a;
```

the hypothetical syntax would look some like:

```c
int a = 4;
int getValueAt_p = 0x0ffadce18f;
```

where `0x0ffadce18f` is `a`'s addof. But later down the program,
`getValueAt_p` is evaluated as 4. This is where the notion of _declaration
follows use_ comes from. The way you _use_ an identifier determines how you
_declare_ it, rather than the other way around. In way, this is a sensible
approach because we're almost never actually interested in the value
`0x0ffadce18f`. Instead, we're more interested in what's _inside_
`0x0ffadce18f`. Moreover, we can interpret the expression
`int getValueAt_p` as:

> "When I write `getValueAt_p`, I get an `int`."

Or, in actual C syntax:

> "When I write `*p`, I get an `int`."

On the other hand, it's a little disorienting for a variable to have an
explicit initial value (some large hexadecimal number), but when evaluated
without any changes, a different value is returned. Moreover, the fact that
compiler errors display the type as `int *`, `double *`, and so on, make it
tempting to write:

```c
int* p;
```

as if the `*` were part of the base type, rather than the variable name.
This, too, is neither wrong nor right (as evidenced by this section's
title, _Pointer Types_). Many programmers begin their journey with a
statically-typed language, so it's only natural to think of data in terms
of type ‚Äî it reduces complexity. This tendency is strong enough that C++
programmers generally write,

```c
int* p;
```

C programmers write,

```c
int *p;
```

and others take a middle ground, writing,

```c
int * p;
```

Our choice of style ultimately doesn't matter ‚Äî it's consistency that
counts.

## Pointer Syntax Summary

Below is a summary of pointer and reference syntax, followed by various
descriptions/translations of the syntax in plain language:

1. <mark>`ùëá *ùëù`</mark>

- Create a new pointer ùëù.
- "When I write `*ùëù`, I will get a value of type `ùëá`."
- "`ùëù` is a variable that will store an address containing a value of type
  `ùëá.`"
- "`ùëù` is the name of an address that stores another address containing a
  value of type `ùëá.`"
- Common mistake: Failing to initialize `ùëù`.

2. <mark>`ùëá *ùëù = ùë£`</mark>

- Create a new pointer ùëù, storing the address of `ùë£`.
- "When I write `*ùëù`, I will get the value of `ùë£`, of type `ùëá`."
- "When I dereference `ùëù`, I will get the value `ùë£`, of type `ùëá`."
- "`ùëù` is the name of an address storing the address of `ùë£`."
- "`ùëù` is the name of an address storing the address named `ùë£`."
- Example:
  ```c
  int main() {
  	int a = 4;
  	printf("addof(a) = %p \n", &a);
  	int *p = &a;
  	printf("addin(p) = %p \n", p);
  }
  ```
  ```bash
  addof(a) = 0x7ff7b46e2d18
  addin(p) = 0x7ff7b46e2d18
  ```

3. <mark>`*ùëù = ùëÅ`</mark>

- Assuming `ùëù` is a pointer to `ùë£`, stores the value `ùëÅ` in the address of
  `ùë£`.
- "The address named `ùë£` now stores the value `ùëÅ`."
- "When I write `*ùëù`, I get `ùëÅ`."
- "When I write `ùë£`, I get `ùëÅ`."
- Example:
  ```c
  int main() {
  	int a = 4;
  	printf("valat(a) = %d \n", a);
  	int *p = &a;
  	*p = 5;
  	printf("valat(p) = %d \n", *p);
  	printf("valat(a) = %d \n", a);
  }
  ```
  ```bash
  valat(a) = 4
  valat(p) = 5
  valat(a) = 5
  ```

4. <mark>`ùëù = ùë•`</mark>

- Assuming ùëù is a pointer declared earlier, this syntax really only makes
  sense if ùë• is a pointer ‚Äî it assigns the address ùë•.
- "The variable ùëù stores the address ùë•."
- "The address named ùëù stores the address ùë•."
- Common mistake: The syntax _highly likely_ does not make sense if `ùëÅ` is
  a literal value. Writing `ùëù = 5` is akin to saying, the variable `ùëù`
  stores the memory address `5`, which is unlikely to be a valid memory
  address.
- For example, this is ok:
  ```c
  int main() {
  	int a = 4;
  	printf("addof(a) = %p \n", &a);
  	int *p = &a;
  	int *q;
  	q = p;
  	printf("addin(p) = %p \n", p);
  	printf("addin(q) = %p \n", q);
  }
  ```
  ```bash
  addof(a) = 0x7ff7bb63bd18
  addin(p) = 0x7ff7bb63bd18
  addin(q) = 0x7ff7bb63bd18
  ```
- But this is not:
  ```c
  int main() {
  	int a = 4;
  	printf("addof(a) = %p \n", &a);
  	int *p = &a;
  	int *q;
  	q = 5;
  	printf("addin(p) = %p \n", p);
  	printf("addin(q) = %p \n", q);
  }
  ```
  ```bash
  	error:
  		incompatible integer to pointer conversion
  		assigning to 'int *' from 'int'
  					q = 5;
  							^
  	1 error generated.
  ```

5. <mark>`ùëá &ùëü = ùë£`</mark>

- Create a new _reference_ `ùëü` to the variable `ùë£`.
- "The names `ùëü` and `ùë£` refer to the same address."
- "When I write `ùëü`, I get the value of `ùë£`."
- "When I write `ùë£`, I get the value of `ùëü`."
- "When I make changes to `ùëü`, I make changes to `ùë£`."
- "When I make changes to `ùë£`, I make changes to `ùëü`."
- Common mistake: The syntax does not make sense if `ùë£` is a literal value.
  Writing `&ùëü = 5` is akin to writing, `0x08afde12 = 5`.

## Pointer Arithmetic

Because memory addresses are numbers, we can perform arithmetic operations
on the addresses. Before we consider how this works, let's be a little more
clear about memory. To do so, we'll examine the output of printing the
individual bytes of some value.

### Printing a Value's Individual Bytes

To print a value's individual bytes, we can use the following function:

```c
void printBytes(void *ptr, size_t size) {
	unsigned char *p = (unsigned char*)ptr;
	unsigned char *q = p;
	size_t i;
	printf("\naddress        value\n");
	for (i = size - 1; i < size; i--) {
		printf("%p ", q + i);
		printf("%02hhx ", p[i]);
		printf("\n");
	}
	printf("\n");
}
```

A usage example:

```c
int main() {
	int n = 3481;
	printBytes(&n, sizeof(n));
}
```

```bash
address        value
0x7ff7b48f3d1b 00
0x7ff7b48f3d1a 00
0x7ff7b48f3d19 0d
0x7ff7b48f3d18 99
```

Examining the output, we see that (addresses truncated for easier reading):

<Mem
	data={[
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "00", a: "0xd1b" },
		{ val: "00", a: "0xd1a" },
		{ val: "0d", a: "0xd19" },
		{ val: "99", a: "0xd18", id: "n" },
		"vdots1",
	]}
	scale={60}
/>

Changing the truncated addresses to integer values and rearranging the
cells from top to bottom, we get:

<Mem
	data={[
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "99", a: "3352", id: "n" },
		{ val: "0d", a: "3353" },
		{ val: "00", a: "3354" },
		{ val: "00", a: "3355" },
		"vdots1",
	]}
	scale={60}
/>

The memory address `3352` contains the hexadecimal value `99`, and the
address `3352` contains the hexadecimal value `0d`. The remaining addresses
contain `00`. The number `d99`, in hex, corresponds to the decimal value
`3481`, the value of `n` in the source code. We write the hex in decimal:

<Mem
	data={[
		"vdots1",
		{ val: "1001 1001", a: "3352", id: "n" },
		{ val: "0000 1101", a: "3353" },
		{ val: "0000 0000", a: "3354" },
		{ val: "0000 0000", a: "3355" },
		"vdots1",
	]}
	cellWidth={60}
	width={400}
	scale={60}
/>

We learn a few things from this output. First, the number of outputs
corresponds to the data type size of an `int` for a 64-bit program ‚Äî 4
byes. Second, the bytes are number consecutively in _little endian_ ‚Äî the
data is stored starting from the lowest address to highest address. And
finally, from our `printBytes` function, it's clear that we can perform
addition on pointers, since they are ultimately numeric values.

## Arrays

From the section on malloc, we learned that the `malloc(ùëÅ)` function
returns the heap memory address of the first byte in ùëÅ bytes. Suppose we
wrote:

```c
int *p = malloc(4 * sizeof(unsigned char));
```

Given that an `unsigned char` is always 1 byte, if we multiply that by 4,
we should get back 4 bytes in heap memory:

<Mem
	data={[
		"vdots1",
		{ a: "0x5...", val: "..." },
		{ a: "0x5001", val: "0x3001", id: "p" },
		"vdots1",
		{ a: "0x3...", val: "..." },
		{ a: "0x3004", val: "...", className: "blued" },
		{ a: "0x3003", val: "...", className: "blued" },
		{ a: "0x3002", val: "...", className: "blued" },
		{ a: "0x3001", val: "...", className: "blued" },
		"vdots1",
	]}
	scale={50}
	width={250}
/>

If those bytes are contiguous, couldn't we write something like:

```c
p[0] = 7;
p[1] = 8;
p[2] = 9;
p[3] = 10;
```

Well, let's try it:

```c
int main() {
	char *p = (char *) malloc(4 * sizeof(char));
	p[0] = 7;
	p[1] = 8;
	p[2] = 9;
	p[3] = 10;
	for (char i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
		printf(" %d ", *(p+i));
	}
	printf("\n");
}
```

```bash
 7  8  9  10
```

Look at that, we get back the values we assigned using the square bracket
notation often used with arrays.
