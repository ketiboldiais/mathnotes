# The CPU

The notes in these materials cover the **Central Processing Unit**, or CPU.
Recall the overall computer architecture:

The _seat of control_, or the _brain_, of the computer is the center piece
above — the CPU, ALU, and control-unit. In the diagram above, there are
control bits sent to each of the chips. These bits function like togglers —
yes or no, on or off. Let's examine how all the parts work together.

## Instruction Handling

Examining the diagram, we see a connection leading to 16-bit multiplexor
and an A-register. An A-instruction leading to the Mux16 might look like:

<Sequence data={[
	{val: 0},
	{val: 0, class: "blue"},
	{val: 0, class: "blue"},
	{val: 0, class: "blue"},

    {val: 1, class: "blue"},
    {val: 0, class: "blue"},
    {val: 1, class: "blue"},
    {val: 1, class: "blue"},

    {val: 1, class: "blue"},
    {val: 0, class: "blue"},
    {val: 1, class: "blue"},
    {val: 1, class: "blue"},

    {val: 1, class: "blue"},
    {val: 0, class: "blue"},
    {val: 0, class: "blue"},
    {val: 1, class: "blue"},

]} scale={70} />

In the bitstream above, the first bit is called the **op-code**. The rest
of the bits is a 15-bit instruction, some numeric value. This value then
makes its way to the A-register.

How about C-instructions? Well, these take the form:

<Sequence data={[
	{val: 1},
	{val: 0, class: "grey"},
	{val: 0, class: "grey"},
	{val: 0, class: "blue"},
	{val: 1, class: "blue"},
	{val: 0, class: "blue"},
	{val: 1, class: "blue"},
	{val: 1, class: "blue"},

    {val: 1, class: "blue"},
    {val: 0, class: "blue"},
    {val: 1, class: "green"},
    {val: 1, class: "green"},

    {val: 1, class: "green"},
    {val: 0, class: "red"},
    {val: 0, class: "red"},
    {val: 1, class: "red"},

]} scale={70} />

Like the A-instruction, the first bit tells the CPU that the instruction is
a C-instruction. The blue bits are the ALU control bits. The green bits are
the **destination load bits**. And the red bits are the **jump bits**.

Now that we've the instructions, let's take a closer look at what happens
in the ALU.

## ALU Operations

Recall that the ALU is _always_ some combinational chip. In other words, it
will always compute some value. If we take a closer look at the ALU, we see
that there are two different sources — one from the D-register, and another
from the Mux-16.

As the ALU receives inputs from either source, a set of control bits are
fed into the ALU. These bits are the ALU control bits we saw earlier.
Putting it all together, the ALU has three sets of inputs:

1. inputs from the D-register,
2. inputs from a Mux16 just before it, and
3. the ALU control bits from the instruction.

We can imagine that if these sets were large enough, the ALU can understand
a fairly large set of instructions. Indeed, it's from these three sets that
the ALU produces its _data output_. This data output can go in several
directions:

1. outside the CPU,
2. back to the D-register, or
3. back to the Mux16 just before the A-register.

Now, the fact that these data outputs can go to three different places
doesn't mean they'll end up in all three. It entirely depends on the
instruction provided. How does the ALU know which of these three possible
locations the data should go? With the _destination bits_ mentioned
earlier.

### Destination Bits

The destination bits are the bits that tell the ALU whether to (a) send the
data to the D-register, (b) send the data back to the A-register, or (c)
send the data towards data memory.

## CPU Control

Revisiting the diagram, we see that there are control bits coming out of
the ALU. These are **ALU control outputs**. These control outputs are used
for the ALU's control logic.

Generally, the control outputs map to either a negative value or a zero
value. To understand why these bits are needed, let's segue briefly to the
program counter.

Examining the program counter, we see a bit called the **reset bit** headed
towards the chip. This bit begins travelling towards the chip when we hit
the reset or power button on a computer. On all modern computers, there are
several preloaded programs. When we push the power or reset button on the
computer, these programs start running. Most of these programs implement
very low-level procedures.

Once the program counter receives this reset bit, it commences its
principal task: counting. Simple as it may seem, the program counter
performs several critical operations:

1. It emits the next instruction's address.
2. If the computer is reset, the count is reset — the program counter's
   value goes back to 0.
3. The program counter increments by 1 each time, unless it encounters a
   jump instructions.
4. If all of the jump bits are 1 (a goto instruction), then the program
   counter is immediately set to the A-register's value.
5. If only some of the jump bits are 1 (a conditional goto instruction),
   then the program counter sets its value to the A-register's value, but
   only if the ALU tells the PC that the instruction's condition is true.
   Otherwise, the program counter increments.

## Overall Architecture

After going through the details, it's worth looking at the overall
architecture again:

Now let's zoom in slightly on the CPU:

	}

	imwidth={"551"}
	imheight={"201"}
/>

Notice how the CPU's inputs are fed to specific pins.
