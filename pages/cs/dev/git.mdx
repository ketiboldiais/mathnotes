# Git
_Notes on Git. In the shell examples, a single dollar sign indicates a one line command. Commands are broken on to separate lines for readability and tabs indicate a single white space. Different commands are always indicated by dollar signs._

## Monorepos
1. Create a new directory: `mkdir monorepo`
2. Run `pnpm init`.
3. Create a new directory: `mkdir apps`
4. In `monorepo`, create file `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
5. Inside that file, write:
	~~~
	packages:
		- "apps/**"
	~~~
	This tells `pnpm` to look inside all of `apps`
