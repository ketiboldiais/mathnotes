# Mechanics

This chapter contains notes on classical mechanics.

## Position

An object's __position__ is the location of the object relative to some
reference point. If we want to talk about this location with specificity, we
choose some coordinate system â€” Catesian coordinates, polar coordinates,
spherical coordinates, latitude-longitude, etc. Generally, we denote position
with the variable ${x.}$

## Displacement

An object's __displacement__ (denoted ${\Delta x}$) is the change in an object's
position during some time interval. Symbolically:

$$
	\Delta x = x_1 - x_0
$$

where ${x_1}$ is the object's final position, and ${x_0}$ is the object's
initial position. Note that this is not _distance_. The notion of distance is
the length of some path that an object travels on. And because it's a length,
distance will always be some nonnegative real number. Displacement, however, can
be negative, positive, or 0. Displacement is a _vector quantity_ (it has both
magnitude and direction), while _distance_ is a _scalar quantity_ (it has
magnitude, but no direction).
