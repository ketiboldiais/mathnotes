# Combinatorics

This volume of notes covers combinatorics, the study of counting. Like number theory, combinatorics is one area of mathematics that manages to appear, particularly when we least expect it. This is particularly the case with one of its subfields, graph theory.
Below is a small sample of some common counting questions.

How many ways can I place ${n}$ marked balls into ${x}$ marked boxes with or without multipacking?

$$
	\large x^n
$$ 

How many ways can I place ${n}$ marked balls into ${x}$ marked boxes without multiplacking?

$$
	x^{\underline{n}}=x(n-1)(n-2)\ldots(x-n+1)
$$

How many ways can I place ${n}$ marked balls into ${x}$ marked boxes so that all the boxes have at least one ball?
	
$$
	2!{n \brace x}
$$


How many ways can I place ${n}$ plain balls into ${x}$ marked boxes, with or without multipacking?

$$
	\dbinom{x+n-1}{n}=\dfrac{(x+n-1)(x+n-2)\ldots(x+1)x}{n(n-1)\ldots(2)(1)}=\dfrac{x^{\underline{n}}}{n!}
$$

How many ways can I place ${n}$ plain balls into ${x}$ marked boxes, without multipacking?

$$
