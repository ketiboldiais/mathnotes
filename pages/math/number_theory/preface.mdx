# Number Theory

This volume contains notes on number theory — the study of integers,
particularly the natural numbers. What makes the integers so special? Well,
perhaps the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski put it best:[^mink]

> _Integral numbers are the fountainhead of all mathematics._

[^mink]: Hermann Minkowski, ~Diophantische Approxiomationen~ 10 (1907).

Reflecting on the history of mathematics reveals why Minkowski might have taken
this position. The integers — barring debate on discovery or invention — came
first.

$$
	\nat \subset \uint \subset \rat \subset \reals \subset \com
$$

It's not too difficult to see why. The natural numbers allowed early humans to
enumerate: 1 apple, 2 hogs, 3 swords, 4 houses, and so on. As time progressed,
human societies grew larger, and the spaces they occupied widened. With more
resources and people, these ancient societies were confronted with increasingly
complex computations — surveying land to resolve conflicts, tracking time,
dividing common resources, calculating tributes, etc.

The methods for performing these computations — with just the natural numbers —
helped provide some of the foundations of what we now know as algebra.
Occassionally, the mathematicians of antiquity encountered peculiar questions:

$$
	x + 1 = 0 ~~~ \mid ~~~ x = ?
$$

To solve these questions, mathematicians created a new set of numbers, ${\uint.}$
Not too long after, another peculiar question appeared:

$$
	2x + 1 = 0 ~~~ \mid ~~~ x = ?
$$

Once again, the mathematicians created another set of numbers: ${\rat.}$
Then the mathematicians encountered another strange question:

$$
	x^2 - 2 = 0 ~~~ \mid ~~~ x = ?
$$

Once more, another set emerged — ${\reals.}$ Then the mathematicians encountered
perhaps the strangest question they'd seen yet:

$$
	x^2 + 1 = 0 ~~~ \mid ~~~ x = ?
$$

It took quite some time for mathematicians to come to accept the set of complex
numbers, ${\com.}$ These new sets have generated their own fields — the reals are
studied in real analysis, and the complex numbers in complex analysis. Number
theory, however, stays at the root of it all: the natural numbers. As it turns
out, there are numerous questions that remain unanswered. This volume presents
just a few of these questions.
