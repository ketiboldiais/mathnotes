# Divisibility

This chapter covers notes on divisibility.

## Preliminary Definitions

__~divides~.__ Let ${a,b \in \ZZ}$ and ${a \neq 0.}$ 


## Parity Rules

Below are some useful properties of odd and even integers that we'll make use of
extensively.

__~parity of addition~.__ Let ${a,b \in \NN.}$ If ${a + c \in \EE,}$ 

<dfn>

__parity rules.__ Let ${a,b \in \Z.}$ Then:
