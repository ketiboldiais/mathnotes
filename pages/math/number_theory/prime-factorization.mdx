# Prime Factorization

This chapter covers notes on prime factorization.

## Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic 

~example~. The prime factorization of 45:

$$
	\eqs{
		\pf(45) &= (5)(9). \\
		&= (5)((3)(3)). \\
		&= 5^1 \by 3^2
	}
$$

We use the notation ${\pf(n)}$ to denote the prime factorization of some integer ${n.}$

~example~. Consider ${\pf(90),}$ ${\pf(135),}$ ${\pf(180),}$ and ${\pf(225):}$

$$
	\eqs{
		\pf(90) &= (5)(18) \\
		&= (5)((3)(6)) \\
		&= (5)((3)((3)(2))) \\
		&= 5^1 \by 3^2 \by 2^1
	}
$$

$$
	\eqs{
		\pf(135) &= (5)(27) \\
		&= (5)((3)(9)) \\
		&= (5)((3)((3)(3))) \\
		&= 5^1 \by 3^3
	}
$$

$$
	\eqs{
		\pf(180) &= (90)(2) \\
		&= ((5)(3)(3)(2))(2) \\
		&= 5^1 \by 3^2 \by 2^2
	}
$$

$$
	\eqs{
		\pf(225) &= (45)(5) \\
		&= ((5)(3)(3))(5) \\
		&= 5^2 \by 3^2 
	}
$$

The integers 90, 135, 180, and 225 are each multiples of 45, and they each
contain the prime factorization of 45. We can use the prime factorizations of 12 and 45 to find ${\lcm(12,45).}$ For 12, we have ${\pf(12) = 2^3 \by 3^1.}$ And for 45, we have ${\pf(45) = 3^2 \by 5^1.}$ It follows that the least common multiple is ${3^2 \by 3^2 \by 5^1 = 180.}$ Thus, we have ${\lcm(12,45)=180.}$ We can verify this by actually laying out the multiples:

<div class={`numbered`}>

| ${\times}$ | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4             | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 15            |
| ---------- | --- | --- | --- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------------- |
| 12         | 12  | 24  | 36  | 48            | 60  | 72  | 84  | 96  | 108 | 120 | 132 | 144 | 156 | ${\red{180}}$ |
| 45         | 45  | 90  | 135 | ${\red{180}}$ | 225 | 270 | 315 | 360 | 405 | 450 | 495 | 540 | 585 | 675           |

</div>

For any two positive integers ${a}$ and ${b,}$ we can obtain the least common multiple through the product of the maximum exponents of the prime factors ${a}$ and ${b:}$


$$
	\eqs{
		a &= p_1^{e_1} \by p_2^{e_2} \by p_3^{e_3} \ldots \by p_n^{e_n} \\
		b &= p_1^{f_1} \by p_2^{f_2} \by p_3^{f_3} \ldots \by p_n^{f_n} \\
		\lcm(a,b) &= p_1^{\max(e_1,f_1)} \by p_2^{\max(e_2,f_2)} \by p_3^{\max(e_3,f_3)} \by \ldots \by p_n^{\max(e_n,f_n)}
	}
$$

This results from an important theorem in mathematics, called the _Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTA)._

<dfn>

__fundamental theorem of arithmetic.__ Let ${n \in \uint : n \gt 1.}$ There are unique prime numbers ${p_i}$ satisfying the relation ${p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_k}$ with

$$
	n = p_1^{n_1} \times p_2^{n_2} \times \ldots p_k^{n_k} = \dprod{i=1}{k}{p_i^{n_i},} 
$$

where ${n_i \in \pint.}$

</dfn>

FTA tells us that we can represent any integer greater than 1 in terms of its prime factors. This also means that we can _construct_ any integer greater than 1 in terms of its primes. It's why primes are often called the building blocks of numbers. For example: 

$$
	\eqs{
		99 &= 3^3 \by 37^1, \\
		1000 &= 2^3 \by 5^3, \\
		1001 &= 7^1 \by 11^1 \by 13^1.
	}
$$
