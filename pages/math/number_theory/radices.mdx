## Notation and Terminology
Before we examine the substantive material, below is a quick review of some notation:

> __~floor~.__ Given a real number ${x,}$ there exists a function ${f: \reals \to \uint}$ whose image under ${\reals}$ is an integer ${n}$ satisfying the relation ${n \le x \lt n + 1.}$ We call ${n}$ the _floor_ of ${x,}$ denoted ${\floor{x},}$ and ${f}$ the _floor function_. 

> __~ceiling~.__ Let ${x}$ be a real number. Then there exists a function ${f: \reals \to \uint}$ whose image under ${\reals}$ is an integer ${n}$ satisfying the relation ${n - 1 \lt x \le n.}$ We call ${n}$ the _ceiling_ of ${x,}$ denoted ${\ceil{x},}$ and ${f}$ the _ceiling function_. 

> __~truncation~.__ Let ${x}$ be a real number. The _truncation_ of ${x,}$ denoted ${\trunc{x},}$ is defined as follows:

$$
	\trunc{x} = \case{
		\floor{x} & \if ~ x \gt 0 \\
		       0  & \if ~ x = 0 \\
		\ceil{x}  & \if ~ x \lt 0
	}. 
$$

~example~. ${\floor{3.14} = 3.}$

~example~. ${\floor{-2.9} = -3.}$

~example~. ${\ceil{3.14} = 4.}$

~example~. ${\ceil{-2.9} = -2.}$

~example~. ${\trunc{3.14} = 3.}$

~example~. ${\trunc{-2.9} = -2.}$

## Number Systems
Consider the following set of points:

$$
	\sd{\ax{{\wc} \dk\dk {\wc} {\wc} \dk{\wc} ~~ {\wc} ~~~{\wc} \\ {\wc} \quad{\wc} {\wc} \quad{\wc} ~ {\wc} \quad {\wc} {\wc} \\ {\wc} \dk{\wc} \space {\wc} ~{\wc} ~~~ {\wc}\quad{\wc} \\ \dk{\wc} \quad{\wc}\\ {\wc}\dk{\wc}{\wc} ~{\wc} ~~~ {\wc}~~{\wc}~~~~~{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}\\ \quad{\wc} \dk {\wc} ~~~~~~~{\wc} ~ {\wc}{\wc}\dk{\wc}\quad {\wc}}}
$$

Truly, this looks tedious to count. It is easier to count the points if they're organized into bundles:

$$
	\eqs{\tx{bundles of 2 }&{\ax{
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		\sd{{\wc}{\wc}}
		{{{\wc}}}
	}}
	\\
	\tx{bundles of 3 }&{\ax{
	\sd{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	\sd{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	\sd{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	\sd{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	\sd{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	\sd{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	\sd{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	\sd{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	\sd{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	\sd{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	\sd{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	\sd{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	{{\wc}}
	}}
	\\
	\tx{bundles of 10 }&{\ax{
	\sd{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	\sd{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	\sd{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	{{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}{\wc}}
	}}}
$$

Suppose the set contained ${3572}$ points. If our bundle size is 10, we can count the number of points by bundling:

1. Make 357 bundles of ${10^1}$ points. This leaves ${2 = 2 \times 10^0}$ points remainder.
2. Of the 357 bundles, make 35 bundles of ${10^2}$ points. This leaves ${7 \times 10^1}$ points remainder.
3. Of the 35 bundles, make 3 bundles of ${10^3}$ points. This leaves ${5 \times 10^2}$ points remainder.
4. Because there are only 5 bundles remaining, we stop counting, and sum the total:








### Numerals
Recall that the division theorem provides the following:

> __~division theorem~.__ Let ${n,d \in \uint}$ with ${d \gt 0.}$ Then there exist unique integers ${q}$ and ${r}$ such that ${n = dq + r}$ with ${0 \le r \lt d.}$

Recall further the fundamental theorem of algebra:

> __~fundamental theorem of algebra~.__ Let ${b}$ be an integer greater than 1. Any ${n \in \pint}$ can be expressed uniquely in the form
> 
> $$
> 	n = a_kb^k + a_{k-1}b^{k-1} + \ldots + a_1b + a_0,
> $$
>
> where ${k \in \nat}$ and ${a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_k}$ are natural numbers less than ${b}$ and ${a_k \neq 0.}$ 

~example~.
${(1101)_2 =  1(2^3) + 1(2^2)  + 0(2^1) + 1(2^0) = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13.}$

In the example above, the base is 2. We say that 2 is the _radix_ of the binary system.

### Base Conversion Algorithm
Below is an algorithm for converting to different bases.

<Algo>

__~base-conversion~__
- __Argument__:
	- ${n \in \uint}$, the number to convert.
	- ${b \gt 1}$, the base.
- __Image__: ${A,}$ an array of bases.

1. ${\let{q}{n}}$
2. ${\let{i}{0}}$
3. ${\let{A}{\ix{~}}}$
3. __while__ ${q \neq 0}$ __do__
	1. ${\let{a_i}{q} \rem b}$
	2. ${A \Lleftarrow a_i}$
	2. ${\let{q}{q} \dv b}$
	3. ${k \inc}$
4. __return__ ${A}$

</Algo>

The algorithm above gives us a quick way to convert numbers to binary in our heads. For example, suppose we're given a decimal ${d.}$ To convert to binary ${d_2,}$ we start by writing ${1}$ if ${d}$ is odd, and ${0}$ if ${d}$ is even. Then, compute the integer division of ${d.}$ That is, ${\floor{d/2}.}$ If the result is even, write ${0.}$ If the result is odd, write ${1.}$ We continue this process until we get to ${1.}$ For example, consider converting the integer ${37:}$

| ${d}$               | ~remainder~ |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| ${37}$              | ${1}$       |
| ${\floor{37/2}=18}$ | ${0}$       |
| ${\floor{18/2}=9}$  | ${1}$       |
| ${\floor{9/2}=4}$   | ${0}$       |
| ${\floor{4/2}=2}$   | ${0}$       |
| ${\floor{2/2}=1}$   | ${1}$       |

Mentally, we might list: ${101001.}$ Simply reverse this sequence (binary digits are read from right to left): ${100101.}$ There's nothing magical here. All we're doing is computing the remainder, but in a cognitively easier way (for most people, determining if a number is odd or even is faster than thinking about remainders). The same goes for converting numbers in other bases. Simply determine if the integer quotient at each step is a multiple of the base.

### Number of Digits
> __~definition~.__ Given a integer of the form
> 
> $$
> 	n = a_kb^k + a_{k-1}b^{k-1} + \ldots + a_1b + a_0,
> $$
> 
> the number of terms (i.e., _digits_) comprising ${n}$ is called the _length_ of ${n,}$ denoted ${\text{dig}_b(n),}$ where ${n}$ is an integer of ${k}$ digits in a numeral system of base ${b,}$ satisfying the relation ${b^{k-1} \le n \le b^k.}$ We define ${\text{dig}_b(n)}$ as follows:

$$
	\text{dig}_b(n) = k = \trunc{\log_b{(n)}} + 1.
$$

~example~. ${\text{dig}_{10}(225) = \trunc{\log_{10}(225)}+1 = 2 + 1 = 3.}$
