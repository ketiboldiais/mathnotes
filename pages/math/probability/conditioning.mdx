# Conditional Probability

This chapter covers notes on conditional probability. We start with a basic
definition:

<dfn id={`#define-conditional-probability`}>

__conditional probability.__ _Conditional probability_ is the probability of an
event given the occurrence — whether by assumption, assertion, or evidence — of
another event.

</dfn>

~example.~ Suppose we had the following events:

From the diagram above, we can answer the following questions:

1. What's the probability of ${A}$ occurring? ${\P(A) = 3/6}$
2. What's the probability of ${B}$ occurring? ${\P(B) = 1/6}$
3. What's the probability of ${A}$ and ${B}$ occuring? ${\P(A \cap B) = 2/6}$

Now consider this situation:

> The event ${B}$ occurred. What is the probability of ${A}$ occurring?

This is our first glimpse of conditional probability. First, we denote the
probability with the notation:

$$
	\P(A \mid B)
$$

The notation above is read: "The probability of ${A,}$ given that ${B}$
occurred." With the basic notation established, let's now do the analysis.
First, the fact that ${B}$ occurred means that everything outside of ${B}$ is
irrelevant. That is, our universe — or sample space — is now ${B,}$ and ${B}$
alone:

Because ${B}$ is our sample space now, we can infer that:

$$
	\P(B \mid B) = 1
$$

Let's get back to the conditional probability of ${A.}$ First, we can see that
some outcomes of ${A}$ are also outcomes of ${B.}$ This is the event ${A \cap
B.}$ We know that this event has the probability ${2/6.}$ We also know that the
event comprising only outcomes of ${B}$ is ${1/6.}$ Because our universe
consists of just ${B,}$ we want to keep the relative proportions in place:

> ${A}$ is twice as likely as ${B}$ (compare 2/16 to 1/16).

Next, we know that these probabilities should add up to 1. Why? Because ${\P(B
\mid B)}$ is 1. Thus, we must express the probabilities as follows:

$$
	\eqs{
		&\P(A) &+& &\P(B) &= 1 \\
		&2/3 &+& &1/3 &= 1
	}
$$

Thus, we ave ${P(A \mid B) = 2/3.}$ Here's a working definition:

<dfn>

__definition.__ Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ are events, and ${\P(B) \neq 0.}$ Then:

$$
	\P(A \mid B) = \dfrac{\P(A \cap B)}{\P(B)}
$$

If ${\P(B) = 0,}$ then ${\P(A \mid B)}$ is undefined.

</dfn>

Note that we can also rewrite the equation above as:

$$
	\eqs{
		\P(A \cap B) &= \P(B) \cdot \P(A \mid B) \\
		&= \P(A) \cdot \P(B \mid A)
	}
$$

This alternative form embodies another way to interpret probabilities:
Probabilities are frequencies. If we perform an experiment over and over again
over a time ${t,}$ what is the portion of ${t}$ that both ${a}$ and ${b}$ occur?
Well, there's a portion of the time where ${\P(B)}$ occurs, and a portion of the
time where ${\P(A)}$ occurs given that ${\P(B)}$ occurred.

Note that conditional probability is just another probability. The term
"conditional" is prepended to highlight the fact that (1) we started with some
sample space at first, but then (2) the sample space narrowed to a particular
event. In other words, it's just a probability where we've changed the original
model.
