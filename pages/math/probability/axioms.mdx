## Primitives
Broadly, probability comprises three types: (1) _classical probability_ — 
probability theory premised on a finite number of equally likely possible
outcomes. E.g., What is the probability of pulling an ${(\tx{ace}, \spades)}$
from a standard deck? (2) _frequentist probability_ — probability theory
premised on the limits of long-run experiments. E.g., What is the probability
of hitting a bull's eye on a dart board? (3) _subjective probability_ —
probability theory premised on subjective interpretations of conclusions from
the previous two types.

### Set Notation
We begin with some set notation we will use extensively.

> __~notation~.__ Given the non-empty set ${A}$ and the non-empty set ${B,}$ we define the following notations:
> 
| ~notation~                      | ~meaning~                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Definitions

Below are definitions used extensively throughout the notes.

> __~experiment~.__ An _experiment_ is any procedure that (1) can be repeated, and (2) has a well-defined set of all possible outcomes.

> __~sample space~.__ A _sample space_ is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. We denote a sample space with the symbol ${\Omega.}$

~example~. Coin toss: ${\set{H, T}.}$

~example~. Toss a coin twice: ${\set{H, T} \times \set{H, T}.}$ Or, more explicitly, the set of tuples ${\set{(H,H)~(H,T)~(T,H)~(T,T)}.}$

~example~. Roll a die: ${\set{1,2,3,4,5,6}.}$

~example~. Roll two dice: ${\set{1,2,3,4,5,6} \times \set{1,2,3,4,5,6}.}$

~example~. Timing Olympic runners: ${\oio{a}{b}}$ (some open interval). The previous examples are instances of _discrete sample spaces_. This is an example of _continuous sample space_. In all experiments (especially this one), we must get the sample space right. Missing just one outcome will almost always result in a bogus analysis.

~example~. Selecting a ${1024 \times 1024}$ black and white image: ${\abs{S}=1024\times 1024 \times 256}$ (assuming 1 byte per pixel). Discrete does not mean "small" or "easier."

> __~event~.__ A subset of the sample space — ergo an outcome set — is called an _event_. By definition, we say that the result of an experiment is an _event_. We denote events in uppercase Latin letters.

~example~. Rolling an even number on a die. The sample space is ${\set{1,2,3,4,5,6},}$ the event is ${\set{2,4,6}.}$

~example~. Rolling a ${-1}$ on a die. The sample space is ${\set{1,2,3,4,5,6},}$ the event is ${\nil.}$

> __~simple event~.__ An event comprising just one outcome is called a _simple event_.

Simple events are also called _samples_, _sample points_, or _points_.

> __~compound event~.__ An event comprising two or more outcomes is called a _compound event_.

> __~event notations~.__ Given the events ${A}$ and ${B}$ of a sample space ${\Omega,}$ we use the following notations to denote compound events of ${A}$ and ${B:}$
>
> | ~notation~      | ~event~               |
> | --------------- | --------------------- |
> | ${A \cup B}$    | ${A}$ _or_ ${B}$      |
> | ${A \cap B}$    | ${A}$ _and_ ${B}$     |
> | ${\nix{A}}$     | _not_ ${A}$           |
> | ${A \subset B}$ | ${A}$ _implies_ ${B}$ |
> | ${A \dup B}$    | ${A}$ _xor_ ${B}$     |
> | ${\Omega}$      | certainly             |
> | ${\nil}$        | certainly not         |

> __~probability~.__ Let ${E}$ be an event where ${E \subset \Omega.}$ The _probability_ of ${E,}$ denoted ${\pb{E},}$ is a ratio of the cardinality of ${E}$ to the cardinality of ${\Omega.}$ That is,

$$
	\pb{E} = \frac{\tx{number of outcomes in } E}{\tx{number of outcomes in } \Omega} 
	= \frac{\abs{E}}{\abs{\Omega}}.
$$

> __~probability distribution~.__ A probability distribution ${\texttt{P}}$ is a function that assigns to each event ${E}$ a probability ${\pb{E},}$ such that: (1) ${\pb{E} \ge 0,}$ (2) ${\pb{\Omega}=1,}$ and (3) if ${A \cap B = \nil,}$ then ${\pb{A \cup B}=\pb{A} + \pb{B}.}$

It's helpful to think of probabilities as physical weights (in a classical sense). The universe (sample space) has a weight (probability). The universe also contains objects (events) which also have a weight (probability). The objects are comprised of atoms (outcomes) which also have a weight (probability).

~example~. What is the probability of rolling a 1 on a six-sided die? The sample space is ${\set{1,2,3,4,5,6}.}$ The event ${\set{1}}$ has a cardinality of one. Hence, we have ${\pb{1} = 1/6.}$

~example~. What is the probability of rolling a 1 or 2 on a six-sided die? The sample space is ${\set{1,2,3,4,5,6}.}$ The event ${\set{1,2}}$ has a cardinality of 2. Hence, we have ${\pb{1,2} = 2/6 = 1/3.}$

~remark on percentages~. Generally, we express probabilities in terms of rational numbers. There isn't anything wrong with using percentages, but it can lead to confusion, given the different contexts in which percentages are used. In some contexts, they're used to denote fractions, in others, measures of change. For example, suppose we're told that ${\pb{A}=40\%,}$ and that an event ${B}$ has a ${25\%}$ higher probability than ${A.}$ Does this mean ${\pb{B}=40\% + (25\% \times 40\%)=50\%,}$ or that ${\pb{B}=25\% + 40\%=65\%?}$ The matter is resolved by making additional statements for clarification, but we don't need to make such statements if we simply used rationals.
