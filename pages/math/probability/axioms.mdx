## Primitives
Broadly, probability comprises three types: (1) _classical probability_ — 
probability theory premised on a finite number of equally likely possible
outcomes. E.g., What is the probability of pulling an ${(\tx{ace}, \spades)}$
from a standard deck? (2) _frequentist probability_ — probability theory
premised on the limits of long-run experiments. E.g., What is the probability
of hitting a bull's eye on a dart board? (3) _subjective probability_ —
probability theory premised on subjective interpretations of conclusions from
the previous two types.

### Set Notation
We begin with some set notation we will use extensively.

> __~notation~.__ Given the non-empty set ${A}$ and the non-empty set ${B,}$ we define the following notations:
> 
| ~notation~                      | ~meaning~                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ${a \in A}$                     | ${a}$ is an element of ${A.}$                                                                                                                                                      |
| ${b \in B}$                     | ${b}$ is an element of ${B.}$                                                                                                                                                      |
| ${A \cup B}$                    | ${\set{x : x \in A ~\tx{ or }~} x \in B}$                                                                                                                                          |

| ${A = B}$                       | If ${x \in A,}$ then ${x \in B,}$ and if ${x \in B,}$ then ${x \in A.}$                                                                                                            |

### Definitions

Below are definitions used extensively throughout the notes.

> __~experiment~.__ An _experiment_ is any procedure that (1) can be repeated, and (2) has a well-defined set of all possible outcomes.

> __~sample space~.__ A _sample space_ is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. We denote a sample space with the symbol ${\Omega.}$

~example~. Coin toss: ${\set{H, T}.}$

~example~. Toss a coin twice: ${\set{H, T} \times \set{H, T}.}$ Or, more explicitly, the set of tuples ${\set{(H,H)~(H,T)~(T,H)~(T,T)}.}$

~example~. Roll a die: ${\set{1,2,3,4,5,6}.}$

~example~. Roll two dice: ${\set{1,2,3,4,5,6} \times \set{1,2,3,4,5,6}.}$

~example~. Timing Olympic runners: ${\oio{a}{b}}$ (some open interval). The previous examples are instances of _discrete sample spaces_. This is an example of _continuous sample space_. In all experiments (especially this one), we must get the sample space right. Missing just one outcome will almost always result in a bogus analysis.

~example~. Selecting a ${1024 \times 1024}$ black and white image: ${\abs{S}=1024\times 1024 \times 256}$ (assuming 1 byte per pixel). Discrete does not mean "small" or "easier."

> __~event~.__ A subset of the sample space — ergo an outcome set — is called an _event_. By definition, we say that the result of an experiment is an _event_. We denote events in uppercase Latin letters.

~example~. Rolling an even number on a die. The sample space is ${\set{1,2,3,4,5,6},}$ the event is ${\set{2,4,6}.}$

~example~. Rolling a ${-1}$ on a die. The sample space is ${\set{1,2,3,4,5,6},}$ the event is ${\nil.}$

> __~simple event~.__ An event comprising just one outcome is called a _simple event_.

Simple events are also called _samples_, _sample points_, or _points_.

> __~compound event~.__ An event comprising two or more outcomes is called a _compound event_.

> __~event notations~.__ Given the events ${A}$ and ${B}$ of a sample space ${\Omega,}$ we use the following notations to denote compound events of ${A}$ and ${B:}$
>
> | ~notation~      | ~event~               |
> | --------------- | --------------------- |
> | ${A \cup B}$    | ${A}$ _or_ ${B}$      |
> | ${A \cap B}$    | ${A}$ _and_ ${B}$     |
> | ${\nix{A}}$     | _not_ ${A}$           |
> | ${A \subset B}$ | ${A}$ _implies_ ${B}$ |
> | ${A \dup B}$    | ${A}$ _xor_ ${B}$     |
> | ${\Omega}$      | certainly             |
> | ${\nil}$        | certainly not         |

> __~probability~.__ Let ${E}$ be an event where ${E \subset \Omega.}$ The _probability_ of ${E,}$ denoted ${\pb{E},}$ is a ratio of the cardinality of ${E}$ to the cardinality of ${\Omega.}$ That is,

$$
	\pb{E} = \frac{\tx{number of outcomes in } E}{\tx{number of outcomes in } \Omega} 
	= \frac{\abs{E}}{\abs{\Omega}}.
$$

> __~probability distribution~.__ A probability distribution ${\texttt{P}}$ is a function that assigns to each event ${E}$ a probability ${\pb{E},}$ such that: (1) ${\pb{E} \ge 0,}$ (2) ${\pb{\Omega}=1,}$ and (3) if ${A \cap B = \nil,}$ then ${\pb{A \cup B}=\pb{A} + \pb{B}.}$

It's helpful to think of probabilities as physical weights (in a classical sense). The universe (sample space) has a weight (probability). The universe also contains objects (events) which also have a weight (probability). The objects are comprised of atoms (outcomes) which also have a weight (probability).

~example~. What is the probability of rolling a 1 on a six-sided die? The sample space is ${\set{1,2,3,4,5,6}.}$ The event ${\set{1}}$ has a cardinality of one. Hence, we have ${\pb{1} = 1/6.}$

~example~. What is the probability of rolling a 1 or 2 on a six-sided die? The sample space is ${\set{1,2,3,4,5,6}.}$ The event ${\set{1,2}}$ has a cardinality of 2. Hence, we have ${\pb{1,2} = 2/6 = 1/3.}$

~remark on percentages~. Generally, we express probabilities in terms of rational numbers. There isn't anything wrong with using percentages, but it can lead to confusion, given the different contexts in which percentages are used. In some contexts, they're used to denote fractions, in others, measures of change. For example, suppose we're told that ${\pb{A}=40\%,}$ and that an event ${B}$ has a ${25\%}$ higher probability than ${A.}$ Does this mean ${\pb{B}=40\% + (25\% \times 40\%)=50\%,}$ or that ${\pb{B}=25\% + 40\%=65\%?}$ The matter is resolved by making additional statements for clarification, but we don't need to make such statements if we simply used rationals.

## Combinatorial Analysis
Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics distinct from probability, and contrary to popular belief, underlies a small subset of probability theory. Much of modern probability theory is instead built atop _measure theory_, the branch of mathematics from which integral calculus and geometry shoot. We cover only the basic combinatorial theorems necessary for the _combinatorial analyses_ of probability theory. We will also present the theorems without proof, as the proofs may be found in the [~note on combinatorics~](./../combinatorics/counting).

### Cardinality
An alternative name for combinatorics is _finite set theory_ — it is the study of finite sets, with a particular emphasis on the cardinalities of finite sets.

> __~definition~.__ Given the sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ we say that ${A}$ is _equipotent_ to ${B}$ if there exists a bijection from ${A}$ to ${B.}$ If ${A}$ and ${B}$ are equipotent, we write ${A \seteq B.}$

> __~definition~.__ Given the non-empty set ${A,}$ we say that ${A}$ is _countably infinite_ if, and only if, ${A \seteq B.}$

> __~definition~.__ Given the non-empty set ${A,}$ if ${A}$ is neither countably infinite nor countably finite, then we say that ${A}$ is _uncountably infinite_, and write ${\abs{A}=\infty.}$

> __~definition~.__ Given the set ${A,}$ we say that ${A}$ is _countably finite_ if, and only if, ${A \seteq \ix{n}}$ or ${A \seteq \nil.}$ If ${A \seteq \ix{n},}$ we write ${\abs{A} = n.}$ If ${A \seteq \nil,}$ we write ${\abs{A}=0.}$

> __~properties of cardinality~.__ Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be countably finite sets. The following properties hold for ${A.}$
>
> (1) ${A \seteq A.}$
> 
> (2) If ${A \seteq B,}$ then ${B \seteq A.}$
> 
> (3) If ${A \seteq B}$ and ${B \seteq C,}$ then ${A \seteq C.}$

The definitions above evidence a preliminary task that's not often mentioned in combinatorics materials: Before we even deal with the cardinality of sets, we must first establish that the sets in question are actually finite.

### Disjoint Sum Rule
> __~theorem~.__ Let ${A}$ be a set of disjoint finite sets ${A_1, A_2, \ldots A_n.}$ It follows that
> 
> $$
> 	\abs{A} = \abs{A_1 \dup A_2 \dup \ldots \dup A_n} = \left\vert{\bigsqcup_{i=1}^{n}A_i}\right\vert = \dsum{i=1}{n}\abs{A_i}= \abs{A_1} + \abs{A_2} + \ldots + \abs{A_n}.
> $$

### Complementary Rule
> __~theorem~.__ Let ${U}$ be a countably finite set, and let ${A \subseteq U.}$ It follows that:
> 
> $$
> 	\abs{\nix{A}} = \abs{U} - \abs{A}.
> $$

### Symmetry Rule 
> __~theorem~.__ Let ${U}$ be a countably finite set. If ${A \subseteq U,}$ ${B \subseteq U,}$ ${C \subseteq U,}$ and ${\abs{A} = \abs{B},}$ then
> 
> $$
> 	\abs{A} = \dfrac{\abs{U}-\abs{C}}{2}.
> $$

Visually, this rule results from the following. Suppose ${U}$ is a countably finite set partitioned into the sets ${A,B,C,}$ with ${\abs{A}=\abs{B}:}$

$$
	^{\normalsize U}~{\wd{A}\wd{~~C~~}\wd{B}}
$$

The cardinality of ${A}$ (or ${B}$) can be determined by constructing a set without ${C,}$ counting all its elements, and dividing by 2.

$$
	^{\normalsize U}~{\wd{A}{\sd{~~\no{C}~~}}\wd{B}}
$$

### Pigeonhole Principle
__~theorem~.__ Let ${P}$ and ${H}$ be countably finite sets, and let ${f: P \mapsto H.}$ If ${\abs{P} \gt \abs{H},}$ then at least one ${h \in H}$ is mapped to _twice_. That is, ${f}$ is _not injective_.

__~theorem~.__ Let ${P}$ and ${H}$ be countably finite sets, and let ${f: P \mapsto H.}$ If ${\abs{P} \lt \abs{H},}$ then at least one ${h \in H}$ is _not mapped to_. That is, ${f}$ is _not surjective_.

### Enumerating Pairs
> __~theorem~.__ Given ${n}$ elements ${\set{x_1,\ldots,x_n}}$ and ${m}$ elements ${\set{y_1,\ldots,y_n},}$ there are ${n \times m}$ _pairs_ of the form ${(x_j,y_k).}$ That is, tuples containing exactly one unique element from each type.

~example~. Suppose ${A = \set{1,2,3}}$ and ${B = \set{a,b,c}.}$ We have the pairs:

$$
	\lset{\ax{
		(1,a) & (2,a) & (3,a) \\
		(1,b) & (2,b) & (3,b) \\
		(1,c) & (2,c) & (3,c) \\
	}}
$$

### Enumerating Multiplets
> __~theorem~.__ Given ${n_1}$ elements ${\set{a_1, \ldots, a_{n_1}},}$ and ${n_2}$ elements ${\set{b_1, \ldots, b_{n_2}},}$ etc., up to ${n_r}$ elements ${\set{x_1, \ldots, x_{n_r}},}$ there are ${n_1 \times n_2 \times \ldots \times n_r}$ _multiplets_ of the form ${(a_{j_1}, b_{j_1}, \ldots, x_{j_r}).}$ That is, tuples containing ${r}$ unique elements from each type.

This is merely a generalization of the previous theorem. Pairs have an _arity_ of two: ${A \times B.}$ Multiplets have an arity of ${r:}$ ${S_1 \times S_2 \times \ldots \times S_r.}$

### Three Possible Cases of Orderings
> __~definition: generic ordering~.__ Let ${A}$ be the set ${\set{a_1,\ldots,a_n},}$ let ${B}$ be the set ${\set{b_1,\ldots,b_n},}$ and let ${f \subset A \times B.}$ If ${(a_i, b_k) \in f}$ and ${(a_j,b_k) \in f,}$ then we say that ${f}$ is a _generic ordering_, or _sampling with replacement_. That is, after an element ${b_k}$ has been mapped to by an element ${a_i,}$ another element ${a_j \neq a_i}$ _may_ map to ${b_k.}$

### Enumerating Bijective Orderings
> __~theorem~.__  Given ${n}$ elements, there are ${n! = n(n-1)(n-2)\ldots(2)(1)}$ possible bijective orderings.

~example~. How many ways are there to order the elements of ${\set{0,1}?}$ There are ${2! = 2}$ ways: ${(0,1)}$ and ${(1,0).}$

~example~. How many ways are there to order the outcomes ${\set{a,b,c}?}$ There are ${3! = 6}$ ways:

<div className={`TableMatrix`}>
| position | 0     | 1     | 2     |
| -------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|          | ${a}$ | ${b}$ | ${c}$ |
|          | ${a}$ | ${c}$ | ${b}$ |
|          | ${b}$ | ${a}$ | ${c}$ |
|          | ${b}$ | ${c}$ | ${a}$ |
|          | ${c}$ | ${a}$ | ${b}$ |
|          | ${c}$ | ${b}$ | ${a}$ |
</div>

Orders are merely _bijections_ from a set of natural numbers to a set of objects. Thus, each of the orders above are distinct sets of tuples.

$$
	P_1=\lset{(0,a)~~(1,b)~~(2,c)} \\
	P_2=\lset{(0,a)~~(1,c)~~(2,b)} \\
	P_3=\lset{(0,b)~~(1,a)~~(2,c)} \\
	P_4=\lset{(0,b)~~(1,c)~~(2,a)} \\
	P_5=\lset{(0,c)~~(1,a)~~(2,b)} \\
	P_6=\lset{(0,c)~~(1,b)~~(2,a)} \\
$$

Each set ${P_i}$ is a mathematical object called a _permutation_, and more generally, a type of _strict ordering_. The term strict comes from the fact that (1) once a given element of the base set ${\set{a,b,c}}$ has been mapped to, it cannot be mapped to again, and (2) every element of the set ${\set{a,b,c}}$ is mapped to at least once. For example, we will never have a set ${\set{(0,a), (1,a), (2,a)}.}$ Orderings free from these two conditions are called _weak orderings_. This brings us to the notion of sampling with and without replacement.

### Enumerating Injective Orderings
> __~theorem~.__ Let ${A = \set{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n},}$ let ${B = \set{b_1, b_2 \ldots, b_m},}$ and let ${\ix{A \inj B}}$ be the set of all possible injections from ${A}$ to ${B.}$ It follows that
> 
> $$
> 	\abs{\ix{A \inj B}} = \dfrac{m!}{(m-n)!} ~~~~~\tx{provided}~~ (n \le m).
> $$
> 
> If ${m \lt n,}$ then ${\ix{A \inj B} = \nil.}$

### Enumerating Surjective Orderings
> __~theorem~.__ Let ${A = \set{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n},}$ let ${B = \set{b_1, b_2 \ldots, b_m},}$ and let ${\ix{A \surj B}}$ be the set of all possible surjections from ${A}$ to ${B.}$ It follows that
> 
> $$
> 	\abs{\ix{A \surj B}} = \dsum{i=0}{n}(-1)^i \dbinom{n}{i}(n-i)^m ~~~~~\tx{provided}~~ (n \le m).
> $$
> 
> If ${m \lt n,}$ then ${\ix{A \surj B} = \nil.}$


## "Impossibilities"
> __~theorem~.__ ${\pb{\nil}=0.}$
> 
> ~proof~. Set theory tells us that ${\Omega \cup \nil = \Omega,}$ and that ${\Omega \cap \nil = \nil.}$ Hence, ${\pb{\nil} + \pb{\Omega}=\pb{\Omega}.}$ That is, ${\pb{\nil} + 1 = 1.}$

## Nonnegativity of Probability
> __~theorem~.__ ${\pb{A} \le 1}$ for all ${A \subseteq \Omega.}$
>
> ~proof~. Every event ${A}$ has a complete with ${\pb{\nix{A}} \ge 0.}$ It follows that ${\pb{A}=1-\pb{\nix{A}} \le 1.}$

## Probability of Not-Events
> __~theorem~.__ ${\pb{\nix{A}}=1-\pb{A}.}$
>
> ~proof~. ${A \cap \nix{A}=\nil}$ and ${A \cup \nix{A}=\Omega.}$ Therefore, ${\pb{\Omega}=\pb{A}+\pb{\nix{A}}=1.}$ Hence, ${\pb{\nix{A}}=1-\pb{A}.}$

## Probability of Or-Events
> __~theorem~.__ Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be events of a sample ${\Omega.}$ The probability of _${A}$ or ${B}$ occurring_, denoted ${A \cup B,}$ is given by

> $$
> 	\pb{A \cup B} = \pb{A} + \pb{B} - \pb{A \cap B}.
