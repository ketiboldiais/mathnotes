# Genesis

This chapter provides an overview of foundational notions and axioms in
geometry: points, lines, planes, and angles.

## Primitives

We begin by defining what are called _primitives_ or _primitive notions_ â€”
propositions and declarations that we accept as true and accurate without proof.
First, a quick review of some basic concepts in mathematics.

First, we denote the field of real numbers with the symbol ${\RR.}$ The mapping
of real numbers to real numbers is the Cartesian product ${\RR \times \RR,}$ or,
more concisely, ${\RR^2.}$ The mapping of real numbers to real numbers to real
numbers is the Cartesian product ${\RR \times \RR \times \RR,}$ or, more
concisely, ${\RR^3.}$ In general:

$$
	\RR^n = \RR \times \RR \times \RR \times \ldots \times \RR
$$

The expression ${x \in \RR^n}$ denotes a tuple of the form:

$$
	x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)
$$

where each of the tuple's components is a real number. In geometry, these
notions have special names:

1. ${\RR^n}$ is called a _space_.
2. The number ${n}$ in the symbol ${\RR^n}$ is natural number called a
_dimension_. When ${n=2,}$ we get the space ${\RR^2,}$ which is called
_2-space_. When ${n=3,}$ we get the space ${\RR^3,}$ which is called _3-space_.
When ${n=1,}$ we get the space ${\RR,}$ which is called _1-space_.[^dim]
3. ${x}$ is called a _point_ or _vector_.
4. ${x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n}$ are called ${x}$'s _coordinates_.
5. The literal, real-number values of ${x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n}$ are called
_scalars_.

[^dim]: 2-space is often called 2D space. Likewise, 3-space is often called 3D
space. We avoid using these terms because they carry a good amount of baggage in
terms of everyday usage. At this level, we want to keep these ideas abstract and
isolated from personal experience; things can get very hairy if we start
mixing personal experience with abstract thought too early. This is not to
say we'll never use the terms "2D" or "3D." We merely avoid them now to give
ourselves a clean slate for thinking about 4, 5, 6, ..., ${n}$ dimensions.
