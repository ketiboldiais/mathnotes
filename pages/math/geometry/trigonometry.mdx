# Trigonometry

This chapter provides notes on trigonometry.

## Angles

If two rays originate from the same point, they form an __angle__.

<Plot
	geo={[
		{
			type: "angle",
			xy: [0, 0],
			angle: 45,
			label: { type: "degrees", xy: [1, 1] },
		},
	]}
	id={"angledemo1"}
	noTicks={true}
	width={250}
	height={250}
	scale={60}
/>

The ray lying along the ùë•-axis is called the __initial side__. The ray that
"sweeps out" is called the __terminal side__. The distance between these
two rays is an __angle__. When terminal side sweeps out
_counter-clockwise_, we have a positive angle measure. And when it sweeps
out _clockwise_, we have a negative angle measure:

<Plot
	geo={[
		{
			type: "angle",
			xy: [0, 0],
			angle: -45,
			label: { type: "degrees", xy: [2, -0.5] },
		},
	]}
	id={"angledemo2"}
	noTicks={true}
	width={250}
	height={250}
	scale={60}
/>

If we sweep the terminal side all the way around to the initial side, we
get ${360^\circ:}$

<Plot
	geo={[
		{
			type: "angle",
			xy: [0, 0],
			angle: 360,
			label: { type: "degrees", xy: [2, -0.5] },
		},
	]}
	id={"angledemo3"}
	noTicks={true}
	width={250}
	height={250}
	scale={60}
/>

If we swept a fourth of the way, we get ${90^\circ,}$ given that:

$$
	\dfrac{360}{4} = 90
$$

And if we swept half-way, we'd get ${180^\circ}$ (this is where the notion
of a line having ${180^\circ}$ comes from):

$$
	\dfrac{360}{2} = 180
$$

At this point, we should probably ask: Why 360? No real reason, really. At
least not mathematically. We use 360 because the Mesopotamians ‚Äî a cradle
of both human civilization and mathematics ‚Äî employed a sexigesimal system
(a system of base 60). The idea of a circle comprising ${360}$ degrees
stuck long after the Mesopotamians disappeared because later civilizations
found the the unit incredibly helpful. ${360}$ is considered a _highly
composite integer_. That is, an integer with many divisors:

$$
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
		6 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 12 \\
		15 & 18 & 20 & 24 & 30 \\
		36 & 40 & 45 & 60 & 72 \\
		90 & 120 & 180 & 360
	\end{Bmatrix}
$$

And with more divisors, splitting the pie "fairly" is much easier. We
appreciate that ease far more when we realize that arithmetic was done with
Roman numerals up until the 15th century. It's not so easy to give someone
XVth of something (the division algorithm didn't exist yet). But, if we can
pretend that something is a pie ‚Äî 360 ‚Äî it _does_ become easy: There are XV
of XXIV total, so just give them a XXIV.

The problem with degrees: They truly have no meaning. It's an entirely
arbitrary choice. We could have just as easily gotten stuck with ${100}$ or
${720.}$ Had the Mayans taken the mantle, we might be using some multiple
of 20 today.

Because 360 is an entirely arbitrary choice, degrees have no meaningful,
reason-grounded connections to other branches of mathematics. And because
those connections aren't there, degrees lead to nothing but pain when we
want to _actually_ talk about angles. That is, treating them as genuine
mathematical objects, worthy of study, rather than just some convenience in
life. To give a brief glimpse of this suffering, here's a famous equation,
using degrees:

$$
	\sin x^\circ =
	\dfrac{\pi}{180}x^\circ +
	\dfrac{\pi^3}{5832000} +
	\dfrac{(x^\circ)^3}{3!} +
	\dfrac{\pi^5}{188956800000}
	- \ldots =
	\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}(-1)^i
	\dfrac{\pi^{2i+1}}{180^{2i+1}}
	\dfrac{x^{\circ^{2i+1}}}{(2i+1)!}
$$

the same equation, in a far better unit called _radians_:

$$
	\sin x = x - \dfrac{x^3}{3!} + \dfrac{x^5}{5!} - \ldots = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (-1)^i \dfrac{x^{2i+1}}{(2i+1)!}
$$

## Trigonometric Ratios

In the triangle below, ${\triangle abc}$ and ${\triangle (a+e)d(c+f)}$ are,
proportionally, exactly the same. This is because of the property of
_similarity_.

The concepts of sine, cosine, tangent,  are simply ratios of the sides of
the triangles.

### Sine

A helpful mnemonic for sine: "Snakes often hide." (sine, opposite,
hypotenuse).

<dfn>

__sine.__ Let ${\theta}$ be an interior angle of a right triangle. Then the sine
of ${\theta,}$ denoted ${\sin \theta,}$ is the ratio of the length of the side

Cotangent: "Cottages are ominous." (cotangent, adjacent, opposite).

<dfn>

cotangent of ${\theta,}$ denoted ${\cot \theta,}$ is the ratio of the length of

</dfn>

### Secant

Secant: "Secure houses always" (secant, hypotenus, adjacent).

<dfn>

__secant.__ Let ${\theta}$ be an interior angle of a right triangle. Then the
secant of ${\theta,}$ denoted ${\sec \theta,}$ is the ratio of the length of
the hypotenuse to the length of the side adjacent to ${\theta.}$

<Grid cols={2}>

$$
	\sec \theta = \dfrac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{adjacent}} = \dfrac{h}{b}

</Grid>

</dfn>

For the rest of these materials, we will use the following variables:

$$
	\eqs{
		\Oo &= \text{the side opposite to $\theta$} \\
		A &= \text{the side adjacent to $\theta$} \\
		H &= \text{the hypotenuse} \\
	}
$$


## Ratio Identities

Recall that the divison identity from real number arithmetic tells us that:

$$
	\dfrac{a}{b} = \dfrac{ \dfrac{a}{c}  } { \dfrac{b}{c} } = \dfrac{a}{\cancel{c}} \cdot \dfrac{\cancel{c}}{b} 
$$

where ${a,b,c \in \R}$ and ${c \neq 0.}$ We can thus rewrite many of the
preceding definitions to alternative forms. These forms are called _ratio
identities_.

### Tangent-sine-cosine Relation (TSCR)

Because tangent is defined as:

$$
	\tan \theta = \dfrac{\Oo}{A}
$$

the division identity allows us to write the right-hand side as:

$$
	\tan \theta = \dfrac{\Oo}{A} = \dfrac{\dfrac{\Oo}{H}}{\dfrac{A}{H}}
$$

Notice that the numerator and denominator are the definitions of sine and cosine:

$$
	\sin \theta = \dfrac{\Oo}{H} \\[1em]
	\cos \theta = \dfrac{A}{H}
$$

Thus, we have the relationship:

$$
	\tan \theta = \dfrac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} 
$$

### Cotangent-tangent Relation (CTR)

Cotangent is often characterized as the inverse of tangent. Why? Recall that the cotangent is defined as:

$$
	\cot \theta = \dfrac{A}{\Oo}
$$

Using the division identity, we can rewrite right-hand side as:

$$
	\cot \theta = \dfrac{\dfrac{A}{A}}{\dfrac{\Oo}{A}} = \dfrac{1}{\dfrac{\Oo}{A}}
$$

That denominator is simply tangent:

$$
	\cot \theta = \dfrac{1}{\tan \theta}
$$

### Cotangent-Cosine-Sine Relation (CCSR)

From the relationship of tangent to sine and cosine, we can also define
cotangent as:

$$
	\cot \theta = \dfrac{1}{\tan \theta} = \dfrac{1}{\dfrac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}}
$$

This reduces to:

$$
	\cot \theta = \dfrac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}
$$

### Secant-cosine Relation (SCR)

The definition of secant tells us that:

$$
	\sec \theta = \dfrac{H}{A}
$$

Using the division identity, we get:

$$
	\sec \theta = \dfrac{\dfrac{H}{H}}{\dfrac{A}{H}} = \dfrac{H}{\cancel{H}} \cdot \dfrac{\cancel{H}}{A}
$$

The denominator in the rewritten expression is simply cosine:

$$
	\sec \theta = \dfrac{1}{\cos \theta}
$$

### Cosecant-sine Relation (CSR)

Cosecant is defined as:

$$
	\csc \theta = \dfrac{H}{\Oo}
$$

Rewriting the right-hand side with the division identity, we get:

$$
	\csc \theta = \dfrac{\dfrac{H}{H}}{\dfrac{\Oo}{H}} = \dfrac{H}{\cancel{H}} \cdot \dfrac{\cancel{H}}{\Oo}
$$

That denominator can be expressed as sine:

$$
	\csc \theta = \dfrac{1}{\sin \theta}
$$

### Tangent-cosecant-secant Relation (TCSR)

From [CSR](#cosecant-sine-relation-csr), we know that:

$$
	\csc \theta = \dfrac{1}{\sin \theta}
$$

and from [SCR](#cosecant-sine-relation-csr) we know that:

$$
	\sec \theta = \dfrac{1}{\cos \theta}
$$

We can therefore infer that:

$$
	\sin \theta = \dfrac{1}{\csc \theta}
$$

and:

$$
	\cos \theta = \dfrac{1}{\sec \theta}
$$

(The inverse of the inverse gives you the verse). Then, from
[TSCR](#tangent-sine-cosine-relation-tscr), we know that:

$$
	\tan \theta = \dfrac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}
$$

Using the alternative definitions of inverse definitions of sine and cosine, we have:

$$
	\tan \theta = \dfrac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = \dfrac{ \dfrac{1}{\csc \theta} }{\dfrac{1}{\sec \theta}} = \dfrac{1}{\csc \theta} \cdot \dfrac{\sec \theta}{1}
$$

This yields the relation:

$$
	\tan \theta = \dfrac{\sec \theta}{\csc \theta}
$$

### Cotangent-cosecant-secant Relation (CCSR)

Because [cotangent is the inverse of tangent](#cotangent-tangent-relation-ctr),
[TCSR](#tangent-cosecant-secant-relation-tcsr) tells us that:

$$
	\cot \theta = \dfrac{1}{\theta} = \dfrac{1}{\dfrac{\sec \theta}{\csc \theta}}
$$

Thus, we have the relation:

$$
	\cot \theta = \dfrac{\csc \theta}{\sec \theta}
$$

### Summary of Ratio Identities

Summarizing, we have the following ratio identities:

<Grid cols={3}>

$$
	\sin \theta = \dfrac{1}{\csc \theta}
$$

$$
	\csc \theta = \dfrac{1}{\sin \theta}

## Radians

With this understanding of triangles, consider the the following plot:

<Plot geo={[{type:`circle`,xy:[0,0],r:1}]} domain={[-2,2]}id={`c1`} scale={70}/>

This is a circle of radius ${r = 1.}$ In mathematics, this is called the __unit
circle__.[^note_unit] The unit circle can be algebraically defined with the
equation:

$$
	x^2 + y^2 = 1
$$

[^note_unit]: The form "unit ${S,}$" where ${S}$ is some shape is often used in
mathematics to describe some simple, easy-to-reason-about object. This object is
then used as a starting point for inferences. Other instances include the _unit
square_ (a square whose sides are all of length 1), the _unit triangle_
(likewise), the _unit pentagon_ (likewise), and so on.

We can express a point on this circle with the familiar
form ${(x,y).}$ For example, the points ${(1,0),}$ ${(0,-1),}$ ${(-1,0),}$ and
${(0,1)}$ all lie on the circle:

<Plot geo={[
	{type:`circle`,xy:[0,0],r:1},
	{type:`point`,xy:[1,0]},
	{type:`point`,xy:[0,1]},
	{type:`point`,xy:[-1,0]},
	{type:`point`,xy:[0,-1]},
]} domain={[-2,2]}id={`c2`} scale={70}/>

However, we can also express the a point with the notation:

$$
	(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)
$$

<Plot geo={[
	{type:`circle`,xy:[0,0],r:1},
	{type:`point`,xy:[1,0]},
	{type:`point`,xy:[0,1]},
	{type:`point`,xy:[-1,0]},
	{type:`point`,xy:[0,-1]},
	{type:`point`,xy:[0.706,0.706]},
	{type:`label`,id:`\\theta`,xy:[0.25,0.22],fontSize:1.1},
	{type:`angle`,xy:[0,0], arms:[1,1], angle:45},
	{type:`line`, start:[0.706,0], end:[0.706,0.706]},
]} domain={[-2,2]}id={`c3`} scale={70}/>

Because the graph is a unit circle, the point can also be thought of as lying at
the edge of a triangle right trangle. And if we can think of the point in this manner, the ${x}$ and ${y}$ coordinates can be expressed as:

$$
	x = \cos \theta,~~~~y = \sin \theta
$$

Remember that cosine and sine are just ratios:

$$
	\cos \theta = \dfrac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} ~~~~
	\sin \theta = \dfrac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$

And since the radius of the circle is ${1,}$ that hypotenuse is 1:

$$
	\cos \theta = \dfrac{\text{adjacent}}{1} ~~~~
	\sin \theta = \dfrac{\text{opposite}}{1}
$$

The side adjacent to the angle can be measured in the amount of steps we take
along the ${x}$ axis, and the side opposite to the angle can be measured in the
amount of ${y}$ steps we take:

$$
	\cos \theta = \dfrac{x}{1} ~~~~
	\sin \theta = \dfrac{y}{1}
$$

It should now be clear why:

$$
	(x,y) = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)
$$

Now here's the real kicker: We can express _any_ point on the Cartesian plane
using sine and cosine. Why? Because of that seemingly trivial law we saw earlier
‚Äî the law of similar triangles:

<Plot geo={[
	{type:`circle`,xy:[0,0],r:0.5},
	{type:`circle`,xy:[0,0],r:1},
	{type:`circle`,xy:[0,0],r:1.5},
	{type:`circle`,xy:[0,0],r:1.25},
	{type:`point`,xy:[0.353,0.353]},
	{type:`label`,xy:[0.3,0.6],id:`a`,fontSize:1.2},
	{type:`point`,xy:[0.706,0.706]},
	{type:`label`,xy:[0.7,1],id:`b`,fontSize:1.2},
	{type:`point`,xy:[1.059,1.059]},
	{type:`label`,xy:[1.1,1.3],id:`c`,fontSize:1.2},
	{type:`label`,id:`\\theta`,xy:[0.2,0.22],fontSize:1.1},
	{type:`angle`,xy:[0,0], arms:[1.5,1.5], angle:45},
	{type:`line`, start:[0.706,0], end:[0.706,0.706]},
	{type:`line`, start:[1.059,0], end:[1.059,1.059]},
	{type:`line`, start:[0.353,0], end:[0.353,0.353]},
]} domain={[-2,2]}id={`c4`} scale={70}/>

The only difference is, the hypotenuse (the circle's radius) changes:

| Point | Radius | ${\cos \theta}$    | ${\sin \theta}$    |
| ----- | ------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| ${a}$ | 0.5    | ${\dfrac{x}{0.5}}$ | ${\dfrac{y}{0.5}}$ |
| ${b}$ | 1      | ${\dfrac{x}{1}}$   | ${\dfrac{y}{1}}$   |
| ${c}$ | 1.5    | ${\dfrac{x}{1.5}}$ | ${\dfrac{y}{1.5}}$ |

We now have a relationship between the Cartesian coordinates, cosine, and sine.
But how can we make this relationship useful? So far, all we've done is tie
cosine and sine to ${x}$ and ${y.}$ With Cartesian coordinates, we can write
${(1,1),}$ ${(3,-1),}$ ${(0,0),}$ or any other pair of real numbers. All we have
with the trigonometric ratios is that:

$$
	(x,y) = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)
$$

We can fix this by passing in values for ${\theta,}$ just as we'd pass in values
for ${x}$ and ${y.}$ But what values do we pass for ${\theta?}$ _Radians_. If we
look closely at the last diagram, we'd see that we marked the angle ${\theta}$
with a tiny curve. That curve is called an _arc_ ‚Äî a portion of a circle. This
is a common convention in geometry, and it reveals what exactly the radian is.

What's the length of that arc? Well, it's a portion of the circumference. The
circumference ${C}$ of a circle is given by the formula:

$$
	C = 2 \pi r
$$

where ${r}$ is the radius and ${\pi}$ is the constant irrational pi. Since the
unit circle has a radius of ${1,}$ the unit circle's circumference is:

$$
	C = 2 \pi
$$

Thus, a _radian_ is simply a fraction of ${2 \pi.}$ Notice that this completely
removes the radius. It doesn't matter how big or how small a circle is, we can
always measure some angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle using some
fraction of ${2 \pi:}$

| Degrees        | Radians          |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| ${-180^\circ}$ | ${- \pi}$        |
| ${-135^\circ}$ | ${-{3 \pi}/{4}}$ |
| ${-90^\circ}$  | ${- \pi/2}$      |
| ${-45^\circ}$  | ${- \pi/4}$      |
| ${0^\circ}$    | ${0}$            |
| ${30^\circ}$   | ${\pi/6}$        |
| ${45^\circ}$   | ${\pi/4}$        |
| ${60^\circ}$   | ${\pi/3}$        |
| ${90^\circ}$   | ${\pi/2}$        |
| ${120^\circ}$  | ${{2 \pi}/{3}}$  |
| ${135^\circ}$  | ${{3 \pi}/{4}}$  |
| ${150^\circ}$  | ${{5 \pi}/{6}}$  |
| ${180^\circ}$  | ${\pi}$          |
| ${270^\circ}$  | ${{3\pi}/{2}}$   |
| ${360^\circ}$  | ${2 \pi}$        |



## The First Pythagorean Identity

From the fact that ${x = \cos \theta}$ and ${y = \sin \theta,}$ we can make
numerous inferences about the trigonometric ratios. Collectively, these
inferences are called the _trigonometric identities_.

Since we've established that ${x = \cos \theta}$ and ${y = \sin \theta,}$ we can
use simple substitution to rewrite the equation of the unit circle:

$$
	x^2 + y^2 = 1 \nc (\cos \theta)^2 + (\sin \theta)^2 = 1
$$

<dfn>

__first pythagorean identity.__ Let ${\theta}$ be an subtended by two radii on
the unit circle. Then:

$$
	\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1
$$

</dfn>

Note that the expression:

$$
	\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1
$$

is really:

$$
	(\sin \theta)(\sin \theta) + (\cos \theta)(\cos \theta) = 1
$$

In deriving the remaining identities, we will use this expanded form, but
express our results in the more conventional notation contained in the
definition above.

## The Second Pythogrean Identity

Since the trigonometric ratios are just ratios, we can divide each by another.
Let's divide all of the terms of the first pythogorean identity by ${\cos^2
\theta:}$

$$
	\dfrac{(\sin \theta)}{\cos \theta}
	\dfrac{(\sin \theta)}{\cos \theta} + 
	\dfrac{(\cos \theta)}{\cos \theta}
	\dfrac{(\cos \theta)}{\cos \theta}
	= 
	\dfrac{1}{\cos \theta}
	\dfrac{1}{\cos \theta}
$$

We see some ratios in there that we derived as ratio identities:

$$
	\tnote{\dfrac{(\sin \theta)}{\cos \theta}}{$\tan \theta$}
	\tnote{\dfrac{(\sin \theta)}{\cos \theta}}{$\tan \theta$} + 
	\tnote{\dfrac{(\cos \theta)}{\cos \theta}}{1}
	\tnote{\dfrac{(\cos \theta)}{\cos \theta}}{1}
	= 
	\tnote{\dfrac{1}{\cos \theta}}{$\sec \theta$}
	\tnote{\dfrac{1}{\cos \theta}}{$\sec \theta$}
$$

Thus, we have:

$$
	(\tan \theta)(\tan \theta) + (1)(1) = (\sec \theta)(\sec \theta)
$$

This gives us the second pythagorean identity:


<dfn>

__second pythagorean identity.__ Let ${\theta}$ be an subtended by two radii on
the unit circle. Then:

$$
	\tan^2 \theta + 1 = \sec^2 \theta
$$

</dfn>

## The Third Pythagorean Identity

Just as we did for the second pythogrean identity, let's divide all of the terms of the first pythagorean identity by ${\sin^2 \theta:}$

$$
	\tnote{\dfrac{(\sin \theta)}{\sin \theta}}{1}
	\tnote{\dfrac{(\sin \theta)}{\sin \theta}}{1} + 
	\tnote{\dfrac{(\cos \theta)}{\sin \theta}}{$\cot \theta$}
	\tnote{\dfrac{(\cos \theta)}{\sin \theta}}{$\cot \theta$}
	= 
	\tnote{\dfrac{1}{\sin \theta}}{$\csc \theta$}
	\tnote{\dfrac{1}{\sin \theta}}{$\csc \theta$}
$$

We now have the third pythagorean identity:

<dfn>

__third pythagorean identity.__ Let ${\theta}$ be an subtended by two radii on the unit circle. Then:

$$
	1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta
$$

</dfn>

## Summary of Pythagorean Identities

In sum, we have the following Pythogrean identities (the additional identities
are simple rearrangements of the three we derived):

|                                       |
| ------------------------------------- |
| ${\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1}$ |
| ${\tan^2 \theta + 1 = \sec^2 \theta}$ |
| ${1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta}$ |
| ${\sin^2 \theta = 1 - \cos^2 \theta}$ |
| ${\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta}$ |

## Root Identities

Given the equation ${x^2 + y^2 = 1,}$ if we solve for ${x}$ and ${y,}$ we get
the following:

$$
	x = \pm \sqrt{1 - y^2} \\[1em]
	y = \pm \sqrt{1 - x^2}
$$

Since we know that ${x = \cos \theta}$ and ${y = \sin \theta,}$ we can plug these in two get:

$$
	\cos \theta = \pm \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} \\[1em]
	\sin \theta = \pm \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta}
$$

This gives us the root identity of sine:

<dfn>

__root identity of sine.__ Let ${\theta}$ be an angle subtended by two radii on
the unit circle. Then:

$$
	\sin \theta = \pm \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta}
$$

</dfn>

and the root identity of cosine:

<dfn>

__root identity of cosine.__ Let ${\theta}$ be an angle subtended by two radii
on the unit circle. Then:

$$
	\cos \theta = \pm \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta}
$$

</dfn>


## Co-function Identities

Having both radians and the Pythagorean identities allows us to establish a
relationship between the trigonometric identities and the constant ${\pi.}$

From our discussion of the unit circle, we know that ${\cos \theta}$ gives us
the number of ${x}$ steps, and ${\sin \theta}$ gives us the number of ${y}$
steps. ${x}$ and ${y,}$ therefore, correspond to the two legs of a right
triangle on the unit circle.

As we likely remember from elementary school, the angles of a right triangle sum
to ${180^{\circ}.}$ Now that we know what radians are, we can reformulate this
familiar idea:

<dfn>

__sum of triangle angles.__ The sum of the interior angles of a triangle
is ${\pi.}$

</dfn>

Now, we know that all right triangles have a single ${90^\circ}$ angle, by
definition. In terms of radians, this means that all right-triangles have a
single angle with the measure ${\dfrac{\pi}{2}.}$ If we so happen to have a
right-triangle whose legs are of equal length, then we the law complementary
angles appies: The sum of those two angles is ${\dfrac{\pi}{2.}}$ And if the law
of complementary angles applies, we get the following lemma:

<dfn>

__cofunction lemma.__ Let ${\alpha}$ and ${\beta}$ be interior angles of a right-triangle. If ${\alpha = \beta,}$ then:

$$
	\eqs {
		\sin \alpha &= \cos \beta \\
		\sin \beta &= \cos \alpha \\
	}
$$

</dfn>

Thus, the magic number (perhaps not so magical) is ${\dfrac{\pi}{2}.}$ Using
the ratio identities we saw earlier, we have the following _cofunction
identities_:

$$
	\sin \theta = \cos \ar{\dfrac{\pi}{2} - \theta}
$$

$$
	\sec \theta = \csc \ar{\dfrac{\pi}{2} - \theta}
$$

$$
	\tan \theta = \cot \ar{\dfrac{\pi}{2} - \theta}
$$

$$
	\cos \theta = \sin \ar{\dfrac{\pi}{2} - \theta}
$$

$$
	\csc \theta = \sec \ar{\dfrac{\pi}{2} - \theta}
$$

$$
	\cot \theta = \tan \ar{\dfrac{\pi}{2} - \theta}
$$



## Sum and Difference Formulas

While the identities we've derived thus far have taken us a long way, we want
more. To propel us even further, let's see what else we can get out of the unit
circle.

Suppose there are two points on the graph of ${x^2 + y^2 = 1,}$ separated by a
distance ${d.}$

<Fig
	link={"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1663094930/math/sum_diff_A_pypyyv.svg"}
	imwidth={"256"}
	imheight={"241"}
	caption={"circle 1"}
	width={"60"}
/>

Keeping the points separated by the distance ${d}$ and changing the angle to
${\alpha - \beta,}$ we get:

<Fig
	link={"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1663095321/math/sum_diff_B_tuaaqg.svg"}
	imwidth={"316"}
	imheight={"241"}
	caption={"circle 2"}
	width={"70"}
/>

Applying the distance formula for the two points on the first graph, we have:

$$
	\eqs {
		d_1 &= \sqrt{(x_1 - x_0)^2 + (y_1 - y_0)^2} \\
		&= \sqrt{(\cos \alpha - \cos \beta)^2 + (\sin \alpha - \sin \beta)^2}
	}
$$

and for the second graph, we have:

$$
	\eqs {
		d_2 &= \sqrt{(x_1 - x_0)^2 + (y_1 - y_0)^2} \\
		&= \sqrt{ (\cos(\alpha - \beta) - 1)^2 + (\sin(\alpha - \beta) - 0)^2 }
	}
$$

Since we maintained the distance, we have:

$$
	\eqs{
		d_1 &= d_2 \\
		\sqrt{(\cos \alpha - \cos \beta)^2 + (\sin \alpha - \sin \beta)^2}
		&=
		\sqrt{ (\cos(\alpha - \beta) - 1)^2 + (\sin(\alpha - \beta) - 0)^2 }
	}
$$

Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:

$$
	(\cos \alpha - \cos \beta)^2 + (\sin \alpha - \sin \beta)^2
		=
	(\cos(\alpha - \beta) - 1)^2 + (\sin(\alpha - \beta) - 0)^2
$$

Let's denote the first term on the left-hand side as ${A:}$

$$
	A = (\cos \alpha - \cos \beta)^2
$$

Expanding ${A,}$ we get:

$$
	\eqs{
	A &= (\cos \alpha - \cos \beta)(\cos \alpha - \cos \beta) \\
	&=
	\cos^2 \alpha -
	2 \cos \alpha \cos \beta
	+ \cos^2 \beta
	}
$$

Now the second term:

$$
	B = (\sin \alpha - \sin \beta)^2
$$

Here, we have:

$$
	\eqs{
		B &= (\sin \alpha - \sin \beta)(\sin \alpha - \sin \beta) \\
		&=  
		\sin^2 \alpha - 2 \sin \alpha \sin \beta + \sin^2 \beta
	}
$$

Putting the two together, we get ${A + B:}$

$$
	\cos^2 \alpha -
	2 \cos \alpha \cos \beta
	+ \cos^2 \beta
	+ \sin^2 \alpha - 2 \sin \alpha \sin \beta + \sin^2 \beta	
$$

Using the law of commutativity, we can rearrange some of these terms:

$$
	\cos^2 \alpha
	+ \sin^2 \alpha
	- 2 \cos \alpha \cos \beta
	- 2 \sin \alpha \sin \beta
	+ \cos^2 \beta
	+ \sin^2 \beta	
$$

Rearranged this way, we can see that some terms can be reduced using the first
Pythagorean identity:

$$
	\tnote{\cos^2 \alpha + \sin^2 \alpha}{1}
	- 2 \cos \alpha \cos \beta
	- 2 \sin \alpha \sin \beta
	+ 
	\tnote{\cos^2 \beta + \sin^2 \beta}{1}
$$

Applying that identity and factoring the two in the second and third terms, we
get:

$$
	1 - 2(\cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta) + 1 =
	2 - 2(\cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta)
$$

That's about all we can do for the lefthand side. Let's look at the righthand.
We'll denote the first term as ${C:}$

$$
	C = (\cos(\alpha - \beta) - 1)^2
$$

Expanding this term, we have:

$$
	\eqs{
		C &= (\cos(\alpha - \beta) - 1)(\cos(\alpha - \beta) - 1) \\
		&= \cos^2(\alpha - \beta) - 2 \cos(\alpha - \beta) + 1
	}
$$

Finally, for the righthand's second term:

$$
	D = (\sin(\alpha - \beta) - 0)^2
$$

Expanding:

$$
	D = \sin^2(\alpha - \beta)
$$

Putting the two together, we get ${C + D:}$

$$
\cos^2(\alpha - \beta) - 2 \cos(\alpha - \beta) + 1	
+ 
\sin^2(\alpha - \beta)
$$

Once again, let's the commutative law to rearrange some of the terms:

$$
\cos^2(\alpha - \beta)
+ \sin^2(\alpha - \beta)
- 2 \cos(\alpha - \beta) 
+ 1	
$$

Once again we see terms that can be reduced with the first Pythagorean identity:

$$
\tnote{\cos^2(\alpha - \beta) + \sin^2(\alpha - \beta)}{1}
- 2 \cos(\alpha - \beta) 
+ 1	
$$

Thus, we have:

$$
	1 - 2 \cos(\alpha - \beta) + 1 =  2 - 2 \cos(\alpha - \beta)
$$

Let's bring the left and righthand sides back together:

$$
2 - 2(\cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta)
= 
2 - 2 \cos(\alpha - \beta)
$$

Dividing two from both sides:

$$
1 - \cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta
= 
1 - \cos(\alpha - \beta)
$$

Subtracting the 1:

$$
- \cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta
= 
- \cos(\alpha - \beta)
$$

Rearranging:

$$
\cos(\alpha - \beta)
=
\cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta
$$



We now have our first double-angle formula.

<dfn>

__cosine angle difference formula.__ Let ${\alpha}$ and ${\beta}$ be the interior angles of a right trangle with legs of length 1. Then:

$$
	\cos(\alpha - \beta) =
	\cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta
$$

</dfn>

Let's draw another formula. If we replace ${\beta}$ with ${-\beta,}$ the ratios
remain the same, since we're on the unit circle:

$$
	\eqs{
		\cos(\alpha - -\beta) 
		&= \cos(\alpha + \beta) \\
		&= \cos \alpha \cos (-\beta) + \sin \alpha \sin (-\beta) \\
		&= \cos \alpha \cos(\beta) - \sin \alpha \sin \beta
	}
$$

This gives us the second double-angle formula.

<dfn>

__cosine angle sum formula.__ Let ${\alpha}$ and ${\beta}$ be the interior
angles of a right trangle with legs of length 1. Then:

$$
	\cos(\alpha + \beta) =
	\cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta
$$

</dfn>

Using this new formula, let's replace ${\alpha}$ with ${\dfrac{\pi}{2} -
\alpha.}$ This yields:

$$
	\cos\ar{\frac{\pi}{2} - \alpha + \beta} =
	\cos \ar{\frac{\pi}{2} - \alpha} \cos \beta - \sin \ar{\frac{\pi}{2} - \alpha} \sin \beta
$$

Once again, we can apply identities:

$$
	\small
	\tnote{\cos\ar{\frac{\pi}{2} - \alpha + \beta}}{$\sin(\alpha - \beta)$} 
	=
	\tnote{\cos \ar{\frac{\pi}{2} - \alpha}}{$\sin \alpha$}
	\cos \beta
	- \tnote{\sin \ar{\frac{\pi}{2} - \alpha}}{$\cos \alpha$}
	\sin \beta
$$

Thus, we have:

$$
	\sin(\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
$$

This gives us the third double-angle formula:

<dfn>

__sine angle difference formula.__ Let ${\alpha}$ and ${\beta}$ be the interior
angles of a right trangle with legs of length 1. Then:

$$
	\sin(\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
$$

</dfn>

We get a fourth double-angle formula by replacing ${\beta}$ with ${-\beta}$ in
the formula we just derived:

$$
	\eqs{
		\sin(\alpha -(- \beta))
		&= \sin(\alpha + \beta) \\
		&= \sin \alpha \cos(-\beta) - \cos \alpha \sin(-\beta) \\
		&= \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
	}
$$

We now have the fourth double-angle formula:

<dfn>

__sine angle sum formula.__ Let ${\alpha}$ and ${\beta}$ be the interior
angles of a right trangle with legs of length 1. Then: Then:

$$
	\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
$$

</dfn>

### Summary: Sum & Difference Formulas

Summarizing, we now have the following formulas:

$$
	\cos(\alpha - \beta) =
	\cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta
$$

$$
	\cos(\alpha + \beta) =
	\cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta
$$

$$
	\sin(\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
$$

$$
	\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
$$

## The Double Angle Formulas 

The sum and difference formulas provide a powerful arsenal for drawing even more
formulas. We know that:

$$
	\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
$$

There's nothing stopping us from saying ${\alpha = \beta,}$ so let's see what
happens if we do that:

$$
	\sin(\alpha + \alpha) = \sin \alpha \cos \alpha + \cos \alpha \sin \alpha
$$

Simplifying the lefthand side:

$$
	\eqs{
		\sin(2\alpha) &= \sin \alpha \cos \alpha + \cos \alpha \sin \alpha \\
		&= \sin \alpha \cos \alpha + \sin \alpha \cos \alpha  \\
		&= 2 \sin \alpha \cos \alpha \\
	}
$$

This gives us our first double angle formula:

<dfn>

__double-angle formula i.__ Let ${\alpha}$ and ${\beta}$ be the interior
angles of a right trangle with legs of length 1. Then:

$$
	\sin(2\alpha) = 2 \sin \alpha \cos \alpha
$$

</dfn>

Let's do the same for the cosine angle sum formula:

$$
	\eqs{
		\cos(\alpha + \alpha) &= \cos \alpha \cos \alpha - \sin \alpha \sin \alpha \\
		&= \cos^2 \alpha - \sin^2 \alpha \\
	}
$$

We now have the second double-angle formula:

<dfn>

__double-angle formula ii.__ Let ${\alpha}$ and ${\beta}$ be the interior
angles of a right trangle with legs of length 1. Then:

$$
	\cos(2\alpha) = \cos^2 \alpha - \sin^2 \alpha
$$

</dfn>

We can manipulate the second double-angle formula to derive a third, using the
Pythagorean identity:

$$
	\sin^2 \alpha = 1 - \cos^2 \alpha
$$

Plugging this identity into the second formula, we get:

$$
	\eqs{
		\cos(2\alpha) &= \cos^2 \alpha - \sin^2 \alpha \\
		&= \cos^2 \alpha - (1 - \cos^2 \alpha) \\ 
		&= \cos^2 \alpha - 1 + \cos^2 \alpha \\
		&= 2 \cos^2 \alpha - 1
	}
$$

This gives us our third double-angle formula:

<dfn>

__double-angle formula iii.__ Let ${\alpha}$ and ${\beta}$ be the interior
angles of a right trangle with legs of length 1. Then:

$$
	\cos(2\alpha) = 2 \cos^2 \alpha - 1
$$

</dfn>

Let's use the same process, only this time we'll use the identity:

$$
	\cos^2 \alpha = 1 - \sin^2 \alpha
$$

Doing so, we get:

$$
	\eqs{
		\cos(2 \alpha) &= \cos^2 \alpha - \sin^2 \alpha \\
		&= (1 - \sin^2 \alpha) - \sin^2 \alpha \\
		&= 1 - 2 \sin^2 \alpha
	}
$$

Now we have a fourth double-angle formula:

<dfn>

__double-angle formula iv.__ Let ${\alpha}$ and ${\beta}$ be the interior
angles of a right trangle with legs of length 1. Then:

$$
	\cos(2\alpha) = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \alpha
$$

</dfn>

#### Summary: Double-angle Formulas

Summarizing the double-angle formulas we've derived:

$$
	\sin(2\alpha) = 2 \sin \alpha \cos \alpha
$$

$$
	\cos(2\alpha) = \cos^2 \alpha - \sin^2 \alpha
$$

$$
	\cos(2\alpha) = 2 \cos^2 \alpha - 1
$$

$$
	\cos(2\alpha) = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \alpha
$$

## The Half-angle Formulas

Having derived the double-angle formulas, let's play with the values of
${\alpha}$ a little. What if we instead defined:

$$
	2 \alpha = \theta
$$

Let's plug this in to the third double-angle formula:

$$
	\cos(\theta) = 2 \cos^2\ar{\dfrac{\theta}{2}} - 1
$$

Let's transpose 1:

$$
	\eqs{
		1 + \cos(\theta) &= 2 \cos^2\ar{\dfrac{\theta}{2}} - 1 + 1 \\[1em]
		&= 2 \cos^2 \dfrac{\theta}{2} \\
	}
$$

We now have:

$$
	1 + \cos(\theta) = 2 \cos^2 \ar{ \dfrac{\theta}{2} }
$$

Let's flip the equation:

$$
	2 \cos^2 \ar{ \dfrac{\theta}{2} } = 1 + \cos \theta
$$

Now let's divide by ${2:}$

$$
	\cos^2 \ar{ \dfrac{\theta}{2} } = \dfrac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}
$$

Taking the square root of both sides:

$$
\eqs{
	\sqrt{\cos^2\ar{\dfrac{\theta}{2}}} &= \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 + \cos
	\theta}{2}} \\[1em]
	\cos \ar{\dfrac{\theta}{2}} &= \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}}
}
$$

This gives us the half-angle formula of cosine:

<dfn>

__half-angle formula of cosine.__ Let ${\theta}$ be an angle. Then:

$$
	\cos \ar{\dfrac{\theta}{2}} = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}}
$$

</dfn>

If we set ${2\alpha = \theta,}$ in the formula:

$$
	\cos 2 \alpha = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \alpha
$$

we get the half-angle formula for sine:

<dfn>

__half-angle formula of sine.__ Let ${\theta}$ be an angle. Then:

$$
	\sin \ar{\dfrac{\theta}{2}} = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - \cos \theta}{2}}
$$

</dfn>
