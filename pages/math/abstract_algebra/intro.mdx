# Introduction

These notes provide an overview of abstract algebra — the study of
_algebraic structures_. That's a big word. What's an algebraic structure?
We'll start with a naive answer just to position ourselves. In grade
school, we learned a variety of facts:

$$
 1 + 1 = 2 \\
 2 \times 2 = 4 \\
 3 - 2 = 5 \\
 9 \div 3 = 3
$$

Later, we learned that:

$$
 \sqrt{-1} \to \tt{can't do that}
$$

and then later:

$$
 \sqrt{-1} \to i
$$

Most of us know that:

$$
 \dfrac{\tt{some real number}}{0} \to \tt{undefined}
$$

But, there's nothing _physically_ stopping us from giving this a symbol:

$$
 \dfrac{\tt{some real number}}{0} := \hearts
$$

and defining rules on what we can do with that symbol.

$$
 \dfrac{\hearts}{\hearts} = 1 \\[1em]
 {\hearts} \cdot 0 = 0
$$

Now, just because we _can_ doesn't mean it's a good idea. On the one hand,
it can make some operations interesting:

$$
 \dfrac{1}{x - x} = \hearts
$$

However, the longer we play with our new friend, the more we realize how
disturbing it is:

$$
 \begin{aligned}
  \dfrac{1}{x - x} &= \hearts \\[1em]
  1 &= \hearts(x-x) \\[1em]
  1 &= \hearts \cdot 0 \\[1em]
  1 &= 0
 \end{aligned}
$$

So now we have to decide: Do we want to stay friends with ${\hearts?}$
Should we abandon our other friend ${x \cdot 0 = 0?}$ This a small hint at
what abstract algebra deals with. We have a box of objects, rules, and
axioms. Abstract algebra looks inside this box and asks questions like:

1. Are the rules or axioms consistent?
2. Are there limitations to the rules or axioms?
3. Can we apply this rule or axiom from this other box?
4. Is there some structure, or organization, to the things in this box?
5. ...

As we can likely tell, abstract algebra has a high level of generality.

### Binary Operations

A _binary operation_ is a rule with these properties:

1. It operates on some set ${S,}$ and
2. it uses two elements of ${S}$ to produce another element of ${S}$

For example, given the set:

$$
  B = \set{0,1}
$$

multiplication is a binary operation, since, using only the elements of ${B}$ —
0 and 1 — it produces only an element of ${B:}$

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     1 \times 0 = 0  \\
     1 \times 1 = 1 \\
     1 \times 1 = 1
  \end{aligned}
$$
