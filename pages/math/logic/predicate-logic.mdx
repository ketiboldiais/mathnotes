# Predicate Logic

This chapter covers notes on _predicate logic_. They assume having read the
notes on [propositional logic](propositional-logic).

## Predicates

Consider the following argument:

> (1) Every man is mortal.
>
> (2) Socrates is a man.
>
> (3) Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

Propositional logic isn't well-equipped to handle arguments of this form. What
we need is a metalanguage that can more concisely handle sentences that use
words like "is", "every", "all", "never", etc. The metalanguage we use to
express such sentences is called _predicate logic_.

For example, consider the sentence:

> Smoking is unhealthy.

This sentence has two parts, an _argument_ and a _predicate_:

> ${\tnote{\tt{Smoking}}{\tt{argument}}}$  ${\tnote{\tt{is unhealthy.}}{\tt{predicate}}}$

We express predicates with the following notation form:

$$
	\sf{predicate}(\sf{argument})
$$

More explicitly:

<dfn>

__predicate__. The sentence

$$
	p(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)
$$

is a _proposition_ that asserts:

> For each ${x_i,~i=1,2,\ldots,n}$ ${p(x)}$ is true.

Each ${x_i}$ is called an _argument_, and ${p}$ is called a _predicate_.

</dfn>

For example, the sentence

> _Smoking is unhealthy_

can be expressed as:

$$
	\eqs{
		\sf{u(s)} \\
		\sf{u}&~\def~\string{is unhealthy}\\
		\sf{s}&~\def~\string{smoking} \\
	}
$$

In the notation above, the symbol ${\def}$ means ${\string{defined as.}}$

## Limitations to Predicates

Predicates allow us to express the notions of ${\string{is}}$ and
${\string{are}.}$ However, if we think about the way we categorize objects in
the real world, we'd realize that categorize in several ways:

> Some ... (is/are) (not) ${\sf{P}}$
>
> All .. (is/are) (not) ${\sf{P}}$

That is, we describe objects as either _all_ having some property ${\sf{P},}$ or
only _some_ objects as having a property ${\sf{P}.}$ We need to distinguish
between these types of propositions to avoid ambiguity and to be more precise.

## Universal Quantification

A claim of the form:

> All ${x}$ are ${y.}$

is called a _universal quantification_. Because its a description of the state
of the world, it is, in fact, a proposition. We use the notation below to
express universal quantification.

<dfn>

__universal quantification.__ The proposition:

$$
	\forall \sf{x} \Seq{\sf{P}(x)}
$$

is a _universal quantification_, read

$$
	\string{for all $\sf{x}$, $\sf{P}(x)$ is true.}
$$

</dfn>

For example, consider the proposition:

$$
	x + 1 \gtn x
$$

In predicate logic, we express this with the logical formula:

$$
	\forall x \Seq{x + 1 \gtn x}
$$

Let's consider another example. Suppose we had the statement:

> ${x^2}$ is greater than or equal to ${0.}$

As a logical formula:

> ${\forall x \Seq{x^2 \gte 0}}$

Alternatively, we may also write:

> ${\forall x \Seq{x^2 = 0 \lor x^2 \gtn 0}}$

## Existential Quantification

A sentence of the form:

> Some ${X}$s are ${Y}$s.

is called an _existential quantification_. In the world of predicate logic, we
interpret these sentences as saying:

> There exists an ${X}$ that is not a ${Y.}$

Why do we interpret them this way? Because it ties well to our previous notation
for universal quantification. When we say that there exists an ${X}$ that is not
a ${Y,}$ we're effectively saying:

> For all ${X}$, there is at least one ${X}$ that does not have property ${\sf{P}.}$

Thus, we have the following definition:

<dfn>

__existential quantification.__ The proposition:

$$
	\exist \sf{x} \Seq{ \sf{P(x)}}
$$

is an _existential quantification_, read:

$$
	\string{there exists an $\sf{x}$, such that $\sf{P(x)}$ is true.}
$$

</dfn>
