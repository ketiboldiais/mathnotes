_First-order logic (FOL)_ is the field of logic most people are familiar with.
It's the kind of logic we'd encounter in a "Logic 101" course, and it's the
logic most heavily used in mathematics. We begin first with _propositional
logic_.

## Primitives

Before we study logic formally, let's set some ground rules. Because of how
low-level logic is, there's a tendency to plunge down an all too familiar
sequence:

> What is ${x}$? ${x}$ is ${y.}$
>
> What is ${y?}$ ${y}$ is ${z.}$
>
> What is ${z?}$ ${z}$ is ${z'.}$
>
> ${\vdots}$

While such questions are important and interesting, we need this sequence to
converge as a sanity check. In logic and mathematics, we avoid infinite
regression by using _primitive notions_ — a concept that is not defined in terms
of previously-defined concepts. We have to start somewhere, and if we aren't
starting at the same place, well, we'll just have to go our separate ways.

Our first primitive notion is a _symbol_:

<dfn>

__~symbol.~__ A _symbol_ is a drawing or mark perceptible by sight.

</dfn>

For example, all of the following are symbols:

$$
  \iff~~9~~\land~~~\lor~~\in \\
  P~~~Q~~~\implies~~~\infty~~\Sigma~~ \\
  \neg~~\{~~+~~-~~!~~?~~0~~ \\
  x~~~(~~<~~\pi~~\sqrt{}~~\int\\
  {\bf A}~~f~~\lxor~~\div~y~~~] \\
$$

From the primitive notion of a symbol, we can construct our first definition.

<dfn>

__~alphabet~.__ A finite set of symbols is called an _alphabet_, denoted
${\Sigma}$. 

</dfn>

For example, the set:

$$
  \set{0,1}
$$

is an alphabet of two symbols, ${0}$ and ${1.}$ The alphabet:

$$
  \set{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
$$

is an alphabet of 10 symbols. This particular alphabet is called the
_Hindu-Arabic numerals_, and each element of the set is called a _digit_. Having
defined what an alphabet is, here is our next definition:

<dfn>

__string.__ A _string_ ${\sigma}$ of length ${n}$ is an ${n}$-tuple:

$$
	\sigma = (a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n-1})
$$

where each ${a_i}$ is a member of some alphabet ${\Sigma.}$ That is, ${a_i \in
\Sigma.}$ There exists a unique string where ${n=0,}$ which we call the _empty
string_, denoted ${\lambda.}$ We say that the first symbol ${a_0}$ in ${\sigma}$
is the _first letter_ and the last symbol ${a_n}$ is the _last letter_. The set
of all strings on the alphabet ${\Sigma}$ is the disjoint union:

$$
	\Sigma^* = \bigsqcup\limits_{n} A^n.
$$

</dfn>

When we want to explicitly refer to a string divorced of all connotations, we
will use question marks. For example, to denote the string "cookie", we write:

$$
	\string{\tt{cookie}}
$$

to denote the string 2518 we write:

$$
	\string{2518}
$$

Next, we define a method for combining strings.

<dfn>

__concatenation.__ Given the strings ${a = (a_1,\ldots,a_n)}$ and
${b=(b_1,\ldots,b_m)}$ on an alphabet ${\Sigma,}$ the concatenation ${ab \in
\Sigma^*}$ is defined as:

$$
	ab = a_1, \ldots, a_mb_1, \ldots, b_n
$$

Thus, we say that ${ab}$ is a string on ${\Sigma}$ of length ${m + n.}$ We define concatenation to be associative: ${(ab)c = a(bc)}$ for all ${a,b,c \in \Sigma^*.}$ We define the empty string ${\lambda}$ to be the identity element: ${\lambda a = a = a \lambda.}$ And we define concatenation to have two-sided cancellation: If ${ab=ac,}$ then ${b=c,}$ and if ${ac = bc,}$ then ${a=b.}$

</dfn>

## Propositional Alphabet

We begin by stating the first few symbols of our alphabet:

$$
	\set{\top~~~\bot~~~\neg~~~\lor~~~\land}
$$

These symbols are given the following meanings:

<div className="numbered">

| Symbol    | Meaning |
| --------- | ------- |
| ${\top}$  | true    |
| ${\bot}$  | false   |
| ${\neg}$  | not     |
| ${\lor}$  | or      |
| ${\land}$ | and     |

</div>

These first few symbols are called _propositional connectives_. Next, we denote
a set ${ּ\tav}$ where each symbol in ${\tav}$ is a _propositional atom_. For
now, ${\tav}$ comprises the Hindu-Arabic numerals, and the Latin and Greek
letters, lower and uppercase. The symbol ${\tav}$ is the Hebrew letter _tav_.

## Definition of a Proposition

With the basic constructions, we define a proposition as follows.

<dfn>

__proposition.__ Let ${\Sigma}$ be the alphabet ${\tav \sqcup \set{\top,~\bot,~\neg,~\lor,~\land}.}$ A proposition is a string ${w}$ on ${\Sigma,}$ for which there exists a sequence ${\seq{s_1,\ldots,s_n},}$ where ${n \geq 1,}$ such that ${w = s_n.}$ For each ${k \in \set{1,\ldots,n},}$ either ${w_k \in \Sigma}$ or there are ${i,j \in \set{i,\ldots,k-1}}$ such that ${w_k}$ is a member of the set of concatenations ${\set{\neg w_i, \lor w_i w_j, \land w_i, w_j}.}$ We denote the set of propositions on ${\Sigma}$ as ${\tt{Prop}(\Sigma).}$

</dfn>

This definition seems awfully rigid, but it can't be helped (we're defining
something that underlies all of mathematics). Fortunately, outside of the
definition box, we can take a breather and look at things informally. In short,
the definition says, a proposition is a string consisting only of symbols from
our alphabet ${\Sigma,}$ which we defined as:

$$
	\tav \sqcup \set{\top,~\bot,~\neg,~\lor,~\land}.
$$

That is, the disjoint union of the set of propositional atoms and the set of
propositional connectives. That string, however, isn't just any string. It's a
string ${\P}$ with at least one of the following properties:

1. ${\P}$ is an atom.
2. ${\P}$ is ${\top.}$
3. ${\P}$ is ${\bot.}$
4. Where ${p,q \in \tt{Prop}(\Sigma),}$ ${\P}$ is one of the propositions ${\neg p,}$ ${\lor pq,}$ or ${\land pq.}$ 

Note that we've defined our propositions in prefix notation — ${\land pq}$ and
${\lor pq.}$ The benefit to prefix notation is that it follows naturally from
our definitions. The cost, however, is readability. As such, we adopt the
following convention without apology or compromise: Given a string ${\land ab,}$
we may also write ${a \land b,}$ and given a string ${\lor ab,}$ we may also
write ${a \lor b.}$

## Compound Propositions

Propositions can be connected with _logical connectives_ to create
_compound propositions_. For example, the propositions "$x$ is less than
_or_ equal to 4" and "$s$ is a member of $A$ but not a member of $B$" are
examples of compound propositions.

Importantly, to form compound propositions, the connected propositions must have
set truth values. In other words, we cannot connect propositions that do not
already have the assigned values of _true_ or _false_. 

## Propositional Formulas

Just as the proposition "${x}$ plus ${y}$ equals one" can be translated to ${x +
y =1,}$ the proposition "If ${p}$ then ${q}$" can be expressed symbolically as: 

$$
	p \implies q
$$

The expression above is called a _propositional formula_. It consists of the
_propositional variables_ ${p}$ and ${q,}$ and the logical operator
${\implies.}$ Let's see what logical operators we have available.

### Negation

The operator ${\neg}$ is called _logical negation_. It takes a single
proposition as an operand, and returns the opposite of the operand's truth
value. Here's its truth table:

| $p$ | ${\neg p}$ |
| --- | ---------- |
| T   | F          |
| F   | T          |

Computer science often refers to the logical negation as the _not-expression_. A
helpful way to think about the negation (and all the other logical operators) is
in terms of sets.

<Plot2
	geo={[
		{type:"rectangle",xy:[0,0],w:20,h:12,class:"yellowRectangle"},
		{type:"circle",xy:[0, 0],r:5,class:"redCircle"}, 
		{type:"label",id:"\\neg p",xy:[-9.25, 5.5],fontSize:2.5},
		{type:"label",id:"p",xy:[-0.5,1],fontSize:2.5},
	]}
	marginTop={0}
	marginBottom={0}
	noAxes={true}
	scale={40}
	id={"logical_not"}
/>

When we denote a proposition as ${p,}$ we effectively create a set called ${p.}$
If the proposition is true, it exists inside this set ${p.}$ If a proposition is
false, it exists outside the set ${p.}$


### Double Negatives

The __double negative property__ provides that, given a proposition $p$,
the negation of the negation of $p$ is simply $p$. We can see this to be
the case from the truth table for ${\neg (\neg p)}$:

| $p$ | ${\neg p}$ | ${\neg (\neg p)}$ |
| --- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| T   | F          | T                 |
| F   | T          | F                 |

### Conjunction

The logical connective ${\land}$ is called the _conjunction_. If ${p}$ and ${q}$
are propositions, then the conjunction of ${p}$ and ${q}$ is "${p}$ _and_
${q}$," denoted ${p \land q.}$ As a truth table:

| ${p}$ | ${q}$ | ${p \land q}$ |
| ----- | ----- | ------------- |
| T     | T     | T             |
| T     | F     | F             |
| F     | T     | F             |
| F     | F     | F             |

From a set theory perspective, the conjunction is a way of expressing the idea
that some object is in both ${A}$ and ${B.}$

<Plot2
	geo={[
		{type: "rectangle",
			xy: [0, 0],
			w: 20,
			h: 12,
			class: "yellowRectangle"},
		{ type: "circle", xy: [-2, 0], r: 5, class: "blueCircle" },
		{ type: "circle", xy: [2, 0], r: 5, class: "redCircle" },
		{ type: "label", id: "\\Omega", xy: [-9.25, 5.5], fontSize: 2.3 },
		{ type: "label", id: "A \\cap B", xy: [-1.5, 1], fontSize: 1.5 },
		{ type: "label", id: "A", xy: [-6, 2], fontSize: 1.5 },
		{ type: "label", id: "B", xy: [5, 2], fontSize: 1.5 },
	]}
 marginTop={0}
 marginBottom={0}
 noAxes={true}
 scale={40}
 id={"logical_and"}
/>

In computer science, the conjunction is often referred to as the
_and-expression_. 

#### Expression: But

The word _but_ is just another word for _and_ in logic. For example, consider
the proposition


> $\string{\tt{It is not hot but it is sunny.}}$

From the perspective of propositional logic, this proposition is no different from saying

> $\string{\tt{It is not hot and it is sunny.}}$

Encapsulating the component propositions to variables:

> ${h = \string{\tt{It is hot.}}}$
>
> ${s = \string{\tt{It is sunny.}}}$ 
 
In propositional logic, we express this proposition as

$$
	\neg h \land s.
$$

### Negated Conjunction

One of the most important propositional formulas in real-world logic
applications is the _negated conjunction_. In natural language, the negated
conjunction often takes the form:

$$
	\string{\tt{not $p$ and $q$}}
$$

This is a bit ambiguous in propositional logic — are we saying ((not $p$) _and_
($q$)), or are we saying (not $p$ _and_ not $q$)? In most everyday usage, it's
the latter:

$$
	\string{\tt{not $p$ and not $q$}}
$$

Thus, as a propositional formula, we have:

$$
	\neg(p \land q)
$$

In computer science, this is propositional formula is often called a
_nand-expression_. As we'll see later, it turns out that if a system has the
nand-expression as a primitive, the system can derive all of the other logical
connectives.

### Inclusive Disjunction

The logical connective OR is the _logical disjunction_. Let $p$ and $q$ be
propositions. The disjunction of $p$ and $q$ is "$p$ OR $q$," denoted
${p \lor q.}$ If, and only if, $p$ is true, $q$ is true, or both $p$ and
$q$ are true, then ${p \lor q}$ is true. Otherwise, if both $p$ and $q$ are
false, then ${p \lor q}$ is false.

As a truth table:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \lor q}$ |
| --- | --- | ------------ |
| T   | T   | T            |
| T   | F   | T            |
| F   | T   | T            |
| F   | F   | F            |

Note that this definition of OR differs from our more common usage of _or_,
which generally denotes "one or the other, but not both." This common usage
of _or_ is called the __exclusive or__. In mathematics and computer
science, we use the __inclusive or__ by default &mdash; "one or the other,
or both." When the _exclusive or_ is used, mathematicians and computer
scientists will make it explicit with sentence structures such as "$A$ or
$B$ but not both," or, occassionally, "Either $A$ or $B$." The _exclusive
or_ (XOR) is covered in later sections.

### Negated Inclusive Disjunction

The negation of a disjunction is called the _negated disjunction_. In everyday language, it often takes the form _neither ${x}$ nor ${y.}$_

<dfn>

__negated disjunction.__ Let ${p}$ and ${q}$ be propositions. Then:

$$
	\neg p \land \neg q	
$$

is the _negated disjunction_ of ${p}$ and ${q,}$ read "Neither ${p}$ nor ${q.}$"
We may also express the negated disjunction as:

$$
	\neg p \lnor q.
$$

</dfn>

In computer science, the negated disjunction is often called a _nor-expression_.

### Exclusive Disjunctions

The logical connective XOR, is the _exclusive disjunction_ (the _exlusive
or_). Given propositions $p$ and $q$, the exlusive disjunction of $p$ and
$q$ is "Either $p$ or $q$," or "$p$ or $q$ but not both." It is denoted
${p \oplus q}$.

The proposition ${p \oplus q}$ is true if, and only if, $p$ is true or $q$
is true, but not both. If (a) both $p$ and $q$ are true, or (b) both $p$
and $q$ are false, then ${p \oplus q}$ is false.

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \oplus q}$ |
| --- | --- | -------------- |
| T   | T   | F              |
| T   | F   | T              |
| F   | T   | T              |
| F   | F   | F              |

Note that ${p \oplus q}$ is the same proposition as
${(p \lor q) \land \neg (p \land q).}$ We can verify this with a truth
table:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \lor q}$ | ${p \land q}$ | ${\neg (p \land q)}$ | ${(p \lor q) \land \neg (p \land q)}$ | ${p \oplus q}$ |
| --- | --- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| T   | T   | T            | T             | F                    | F                                     | F              |
| T   | F   | T            | F             | T                    | T                                     | T              |
| F   | T   | T            | F             | T                    | T                                     | T              |
| F   | F   | F            | F             | T                    | F                                     | F              |


### Evaluation Order

Compound propositions themselves can be connect to form more complicated
expressions:

$$
	\neg p \lor q \\
	(\neg p \lor q) \land \neg (p \lor q) \\
	\neg ((p \land q) \lor (p \land (p \lor \neg q)))
$$

When evaluating these more complicated expressions, we follow a convention
called the _Boolean order of operations_:

1. Parenthesized expressions are evaluated first, following these rules.
2. Negations are evaluated second.
3. Conjunctions are performed third.
4. Inclusive/exclusive disjunctions are performed last.

An interesting thing to note is that this is purely a convention. We could have
used an entirely different order, but this is the order most people have agreed
on.

## Logical Equivalence

The propositions "2 is greater than 1" and "1 is less than 2" are two
different ways of saying the same thing. This is because of the definitions
of the words &#8220;greater than&#8221; and &#8220;less than.&#8221; Both
propositions, together, can only be: (1) both true, or (2) both false. In
other words, if the propositions were connected with a logical connective and
evaluated in a truth table, their truth values would be identical.

For example, suppose $p$ and $q$ are propositions. The compound
propositions ${p \land q}$ and ${q \land p}$ have the same truth values:

| ${p}$ | ${q}$ | ${p \land q}$ | ${q \land p}$ |
| ----- | ----- | ------------- | ------------- |
| T     | T     | T             | T             |
| T     | F     | F             | F             |
| F     | T     | F             | F             |
| F     | F     | F             | F             |

When two _proposition forms_ have the same truth values, we say that they
are _logically equivalent_. More formally, two proposition forms are
logically equivalent if, and only if, they have identical truth values
for each possible substitution of propositions for their proposition variables.
The logical equivalence of proposition forms $p$ and $q$ is denoted by
writing ${p \equiv q.}$

Because of logical equivalence, there are logical properties we can use in all
situations. We will explore some tactics for evaluating logical equivalences
once we've covered conditonals.

## De Morgan's Laws

Consider the following proposition:

> Apples are red and sweet.

As we know, this is a compound proposition:

> (1) Apples are red.
> 
> (2) Apples are sweet.

For the proposition to be false, one or both of (1) and (2) must be false. That is,

> Apples are _not_ red _and_ sweet.
> 
> Apples are red _and not_ sweet
>
> Apples are _not_ red _and_ are _not_ sweet.
 
These propositions can be reduced to a single proposition:

> Apples are _not_ red _or_ are _not_ sweet."

Similarly, consider the proposition:

> Apples are red _or_ green.
 
Like the previous proposition, this is a compound proposition consisting of two
propositions:

> (1) Apples are red
>
> (2) Apples are green.

Thus, for the compound proposition to be false, both (1) and (2) must be false,
since a disjunction is false if, and only if, both of its component
propositions are false. The negation then is:

> Apples are _not_ red _and_ are _not_ green.

De Morgan's laws formalize this reduction. The negation of a conjunction is
logically equivalent to a disjunction, where each component proposition is
_negated_. The negation of a disjunction is logically equivalent to a
conjunction where each component proposition is _negated_.

<dfn>

__de morgan's laws.__ Let ${p}$ and ${q}$ be propositions. Then:

$$

	\eqs{
		& \neg (p \land q) \equiv \neg p \lor \neg q \\[1em]
		& \neg (p \lor q) \equiv \neg p \land \neg q
	}
	
$$

</dfn>

A truth table demonstrates the logical equivalences:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${\neg p}$ | ${\neg q}$ | ${p \land q}$ | ${\neg (p \land q)}$ | ${\neg p \lor \neg q}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| T   | T   | F          | F          | T             | F                    | F                      |
| T   | F   | F          | T          | F             | T                    | T                      |
| F   | T   | T          | F          | F             | T                    | T                      |
| F   | F   | T          | T          | F             | T                    | T                      |

The negation of a disjunction is often written in the form of _neither nor_.
Consider the proposition

> Cats are sympathetic or lively.

The negated proposition is:

> Cats are _not_ sympathetic and are _not_ lively.

Style, not logic, leads to the more common form:

> Cats are _neither_ sympathetic _nor_ lively.

## Tautology

A _tautology_ is a propositional formula that always reduces to true, regardless
of its component propositions's truth values. A proposition whose form is a
tautology is called a _tautological proposition_.  For example, consider the
proposition:

> Beijing is the capital of China _or_ Beijing is _not_ the capital of China.

Let's suppose: 

$$
	p = \text{Beijing is the capital of China.}
$$

As a propositional formula:


$$
	p \lor \neg p
$$

As a truth table:

| $p$ | $\neg p$ | ${p \lor \neg p}$ |
| --- | -------- | ----------------- |
| T   | F        | T                 |
| F   | T        | T                 |

We see that ${p \lor \neg p}$ will always be true, regardless of what truth
values are assigned to $p$. Thus, we say that ${p \lor \neg p}$ is a tautology:

$$
	\top (p \lor \neg p)
$$

The symbol $\top$ is called the _verum_ symbol, and means "always true".

## Contradictions

In contrast to the tautology, a _contradiction_ is a propositional formula that
always reduces to _false_, regardless of the truth values of the individual
propositions substituted for the propositional form's variables. For
example, consider the proposition:

> Dogs are cute and dogs are not cute.

Suppose:

$$
	d = \text{Dogs are cute.}
$$
	
	
As a propositional formula:

$$
	d \land \neg d.
$$


As a truth table:

| $d$ | $\neg d$ | ${d \land \neg d}$ |
| --- | -------- | ------------------ |
| T   | F        | F                  |
| F   | T        | F                  |.

We see that ${d \land \neg d}$ is always false, regardless of the truth value of
${d}$. Thus, we say that ${d \land \neg d}$ is a contradiction. We
denote this fact with the logical notation:

$$
	\bot (d \land \neg d)
$$

The symbol ${\bot}$ is the _falsum_ symbol, and means "always false."

## Conditional Propositions

When we reason _from_ a hypothesis to a _conclusion_, we make a
_deduction_. This act is embodied in the proposition:

$$
	\tt{If ${p}$ then ${q.}$}
$$

We call this proposition a _conditional_ and we denote it as:

$$
	\large p \implies q
$$

The symbol ${\implies}$ is a logical connective just like ${\land}$, ${\lor}$, ${\neg}$, etc. The proposition ${p}$ is called the _sufficient condition_, and the proposition ${q}$ is called the _necessary condition_.[^implies_note].

[^implies_note]:
    In the order of operations, the logical connective ${\implies}$ is
    performed last.

### When Is a Conditional False?

Consider the following proposition:

> If Paris picks Hera, then there will be no war.

When is this proposition false? It is false if, and only if, Paris picks Hera and there is a war (i.e., the sufficient condition is true and the necessary condition is false). Otherwise, the conditional ${p \implies q}$ is true.

| ${p}$ | ${q}$ | ${p \implies q}$ |
| ----- | ----- | ---------------- |
| T     | T     | T                |
| T     | F     | F                |
| F     | T     | T                |
| F     | F     | T                |

If a conditional proposition's necessary condition is true
because its sufficient condition is false, we say that the proposition is
_vacuously true_. For example, consider the proposition:

> If one is less than zero, then one plus one is two.

Clearly, the sufficient condition is false, and the necessary condition is true.
The proposition, however, is vacuously true. To see why we vacuous truth sense,
let's consider a logical equivalence of an implication. 

## Implications as Logical Disjunctions

The conditionals is logically equivalent to disjunctions. In fact, this is
apparent from every day speech. Consider the proposition:

> Either you study or you receive poor grades.

Let's rewrite this symbolically using the following variables:

| Variable   | Signified                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ${\neg p}$ | ${{\tt{you study}}}$               |
| ${p}$      | ${{\tt{you do not study}}}$        |
| ${q}$      | ${{\tt{you receive poor grades}}}$ |

Using the variables above, we have the propositional formula:

$$
	(\neg p) \lor q
$$

Now consider the proposition is:

> If you do not study, then you receive poor grades.

Symbolically:

$$
	s \implies r.
$$

Let's look at their truth tables.

| $p$ | $q$ | ${\neg p}$ | ${p \implies q}$ | ${(\neg p) \lor q}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| T   | T   | F          | T                | T                   |
| T   | F   | F          | F                | F                   |
| F   | T   | T          | T                | T                   |
| F   | F   | T          | T                | T                   |

Both ${p \implies q}$ and ${\neg p \lor q}$ have the same truth values;
they are logically equivalent.Similarly, if ${q \implies p,}$ then
${(q \implies p) \equiv ((\neg q) \lor p).}$

| $q$ | $p$ | ${\neg q}$ | ${q \implies p}$ | ${(\neg q) \lor p}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| T   | T   | F          | T                | T                   |
| T   | F   | F          | F                | F                   |
| F   | T   | T          | T                | T                   |
| F   | F   | T          | T                | T                   |

Accordingly, we have the following logical equivalence:

<dfn>

__lemma__. Given propositions ${p}$ and ${q,}$

$$
	p \implies q \equiv q \lor (\neg p)
$$

or

$$
	p \implies q \equiv (\neg p) \lor q
$$

</dfn>

## Negative Implications

Let's take a closer look at that equivalence ${(p \implies q) \equiv (\neg p \lor q).}$ If we negate both sides, we get:

$$
	\neg (p \implies q) \equiv \neg ((\neg p) \lor q).
$$

Applying De Morgan's laws,

$$
	\neg (p \implies q) \equiv \neg ((\neg p) \lor q).
$$

By the double negative law, we have

$$
	\neg (p \implies q) \equiv p \land (\neg q).
$$

Therefore, it follows that

$$
	\neg (p \implies q) \equiv (p \land \neg q).
$$

In other words, the negation of _if ${p}$ then ${q}$_ is
_${p}$ and not ${q}$_. Let's see an example.

> If I timely submit my assignment, I will not lose points.
>
> I timely submit my assignment, but I lose points.

For those fond of Victorian horror:

> If Dracula is a man, then Dracula is human.
>
> Dracula is a man but not human.

Accordingly, we have the following theorem:

<dfn>

__lemma__. Given propositions ${p}$ and ${q,}$

$$
  \neg (p \implies q) ~~ \equiv ~~ \neg q \lor (\neg p) ~~ \equiv ~~ (\neg q) \land p.
$$

</dfn>

## The Contrapositive

A particularly useful equivalence is that between a conditonal and its
_contrapositive_. Consider the proposition: 

> If I go to class, then I will attend lecture.
 
The contrapositive of this proposition is:

> If I do not attend lecture, then I do not go to class.

<dfn>

__contrapositive.__ Let ${p}$ and ${q}$ be propositions. Then

$$
	p \implies q ~~\equiv~~ \not q \implies \not p
$$

We call the proposition ${\not q \implies \not p}$ the _contrapositive_ of ${p
\implies q.}$

</dfn>

We can verify the logical equivalence claimed with a proof table. Suppose ${a}$
and ${b}$ are propositions:

| $a$ | $b$ | ${\neg b}$ | ${\neg a}$ | ${a \implies b}$ | ${\neg b \implies \neg a}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| T   | T   | F          | F          | T                | T                          |
| T   | F   | T          | F          | F                | F                          |
| F   | T   | F          | T          | T                | T                          |
| F   | F   | T          | T          | T                | T                          |.

The fact that a conditional's contrapositive is logically equivalent to the
conditional is a valuable asset. Often, proving a conditional proposition's
contrapositive is much easier than proving the conditional proposition
itself.

### The Converse

The _converse_ of a proposition is formed when the proposition's
necessary and sufficient conditions are switched:

| Proposition                            | Converse                               |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| If Bo is a horse, then Bo is a mammal. | If Bo is a mammal, then Bo is a horse. |

<dfn>

__converse.__ Let ${p}$ and ${q}$ be propositions. Then the converse of ${p \implies q}$ is the proposition

$$
	q \implies p.
$$

We may also denote the converse as

$$
	p \impliedby q
$$

which is read as "${q}$ is implied by ${p}$."

</dfn>

It's very important to understand that the converse of a conditional is not
logically equivalent to the conditional. We can see that this is true with a
truth table. Let ${p}$ and ${q}$ be propositions:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \implies q}$ | ${q \implies p}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| T   | T   | T                | T                |
| T   | F   | F                | T                |
| F   | T   | T                | F                |
| F   | F   | T                | T                |

We will revisit the converse when we examine another propositional formula
called the biconditional.

### The Inverse

When we negate the sufficient and necessary conditions of conditional
proposition while keeping their order in place, we get the conditional's
_inverse_.

<dfn>

__inverse.__ Let ${p}$ and ${q}$ be propositions. Then the _inverse_ of ${p \implies q}$ is

$$
	\neg q \implies \neg p
$$

</dfn>

For example:

| Proposition                                              | Inverse                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| If Sam entered the home, then she is guilty of burglary. | If Sam did not enter the home, then she is not guilty of burglary. |

Like the converse, the inverse of a conditional is not logically equivalent
to the conditional:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${\neg p}$ | ${\neg q}$ | ${p \implies q}$ | ${(\neg p) \implies (\neg q)}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| T   | T   | F          | F          | T                | T                              |
| T   | F   | F          | T          | F                | T                              |
| F   | T   | T          | F          | T                | F                              |
| F   | F   | T          | T          | T                | T                              |

### Equivalence of Converse and Inverse

Although both the converse and inverse of a conditional are not logically
equivalent to the conditional, the converse of a conditional is logically
equivalent to the inverse of a conditional, and vice versa.

| $p$ | $q$ | ${\neg p}$ | ${\neg q}$ | ${p \implies q}$ | ${q \implies p}$ | ${(\neg p) \implies (\neg q)}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| T   | T   | F          | F          | T                | T                | T                              |
| T   | F   | F          | T          | F                | T                | T                              |
| F   | T   | T          | F          | F                | F                | F                              |
| F   | F   | T          | T          | F                | T                | T                              |

## Idiom: Only If

The idiom _only if_ introduces a necessary condition. In other words,
when we say "A only if B", we are saying "If A occurs, B MUST occur;" that
is, "If b does not occur, a does not occur."

Formally, given propositions $a$ and $b$, the proposition "$a$ only if $b$"
is denoted as:

$$
	a \implies b
$$

or, equivalently,

$$
	(\neg b) \implies (\neg a)
$$

## The Biconditional

A _biconditional proposition_ (a "biconditional") is a conditional
proposition where both component propositions are the necessary and
sufficient conditions. The biconditional most often takes the form "$p$ if,
and only if, $q$". The words _if and only if_ are sometimes abbreviated:

$$
	\string{\tt{iff}}
$$

We will follow this convention. The biconditional ${p \iff q}$ is true if both
$p$ and $q$ have the same true values and is false if $p$ and $q$ have opposite
truth values. The biconditional has the truth table:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \iff q}$ |
| --- | --- | ------------ |
| T   | T   | T            |
| T   | F   | F            |
| F   | T   | F            |
| F   | F   | T            |

Consider the following truth table:

| $p$ | $q$ | ${p \implies q}$ | ${q \implies p}$ | ${p \iff q}$ | ${(p \implies q) \land (q \implies p)}$ |
| --- | --- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| T   | T   | T                | T                | T            | T                                       |
| T   | F   | F                | T                | F            | F                                       |
| F   | T   | T                | F                | F            | F                                       |
| F   | F   | T                | T                | T            | T                                       |

Observe that the biconditional "$p$ iff $q$" is logically equivalent to
"$p$ if $q$ and $q$ if $p$." In other words, the biconditional is logically
equivalent to the conjunction of the conditional and its converse.
Symbolically:

$$
	(p \iff q) \equiv ((p \implies q) \land (q \implies p))
$$

This is helpful result. Biconditionals are much easier to prove or work
with when they are reduced to the conditional and its converse.
