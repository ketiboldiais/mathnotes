## Introduction
Symbolic logic, fundamentally, is a _sanity check_. Human critique points out the imperfections in the entities we create — whether that entity is hardware, software, a novel, proof, art, music, and so on. Before the critique stage, there are various application-specific tools we might use: Focus groups, stress tests, debuggers, spell-check, statistics, etc. All of these tools, however, require us to create either a complete prototype or some component of the entity. None of them work without our placing time and effort into instantiation. The only tool unshackled to this requirement is _symbolic logic_. This liberty is both a gift and a curse. Of all the knowledge domains, logic is the most unforgiving, totalitarian, and treacherous. Its resident propositions and theorems are creators at genesis. And as creators, they both giveth and taketh away: Logic may enlight the darkest abodes of reasoning, but it may equally set them ablaze. The primary question of logic: How do we control this fire? Answering this question is the study of logic.

### Axioms and Models
We begin by defining a model.

> __~definition: model~.__ A collection of objects and relations betwen the objects in the collection.

~example~. ${\text{model}=\set{\tx{apples}, \tx{peaches}, \tx{apples and peaches are round}}}$

~example~. ${\text{model}=\set{a,b,c,d \lt b, c \lt d}.}$

> __~definition: axiom~.__ A true statement about a model.

> __~definition: axiomatic system~.__ A collection of axioms.

~example~.

$$
	\tx{model}:\lset{\ax{
		\tx{objects}&:& \lset{\tx{herrings},\tx{birds}} \\
		\tx{relations}&:& \lset{\tx{birds are not herrings}} \\
	}} \\[1em]
	\lset{\ax{
		\tx{axioms}&:& \lset{\tx{all herrings are red},~\tx{all birds are spies}} \\
	}}
$$

> __~inference rule~.__ A procedure that takes an axiom and returns another axiom. By convention, we call the return value of an inference rule a _theorem_.

$$
	\tx{model}:\lset{\ax{
		\tx{objects}&:& \lset{\tx{herrings},\tx{birds}} \\
		\tx{relations}&:& \lset{\tx{birds are not herrings}} \\
	}} \\[1em]
	\lset{\ax{
		\tx{axioms}&:& \lset{\tx{all herrings are red},~\tx{all birds are spies}} \\
		\tx{inference rules}&:& \lset{\tx{all $x$ are $y$, all $y$ are $z$, then all $x$ are $z$}}} \\
	}
$$

> __~theory~.__ A collection of axioms and inference rules.

$$
	\tx{model}:\lset{\ax{
		\tx{objects}&:& \lset{\tx{herrings},\tx{birds}} \\
		\tx{relations}&:& \lset{\tx{birds are not herrings}} \\
	}} \\[1em]
	\tx{theory}: \lset{\ax{
		\tx{axioms}&:& \lset{\tx{all herrings are red},~\tx{all birds are spies}} \\
		\tx{inference rules}&:& \lset{\tx{all $x$ are $y$, all $y$ are $z$, then all $x$ are $z$}}} \\
	}
$$

### Consistency
There are several benchmarks we can use to evaluate theories.

> __~definition: consistency~.__ A theory is _consistent_ if, and only if, for any axiom ${a,}$ and for any inference rule ${f,}$ ${f}$ returns exactly one of ${(a,t)}$ or ${(a,\tx{not} ~ t)}$ where ${t}$ is a theorem. Otherwise, a theory is _inconsistent_.

The definition of consistency introduces an interesting challenge for theories. If we have too many axioms, we increase the risk of an inconsistency. If we have too few axioms, we underconstrain the theory, and we either have to do much more work to apply it to models, or remain content with its reduced utility.

Much of mathematics relies on theories that others have gone through the trouble of error checking and debugging. A particularly popular theory is set theory (which itself comes in a wide variety), but there are alternatives: lambda calculus, object calculus, second-order arithmetic, category theory, etc. 

## Primitives
Before we study logic formally, let's set some ground rules. Because of how low-level logic is, there's a tendency to plunge down an all too familiar sequence: What is ${x}$? ${x}$ is ${y.}$ What is ${y?}$ ${y}$ is ${z.}$ What is ${z?}$ ${z}$ is ${z' \ldots}$ While such questions are important and interesting, we need this sequence to converge. In logic and mathematics, we avoid infinite regression by using _primitive notions_ — a concept that is not defined in terms of previously-defined concepts. We have to start somewhere, and if we aren't starting at the same place, well, we'll just have to go our separate ways. Our first primitive notion is a _symbol_:

> __~symbol~.__ A _symbol_ is a drawing or mark perceptible by sight or sound.

~example~. All of the following are symbols:

$$
  \iff~~9~~\land~~~\lor~~\in \\
  P~~~Q~~~\nc~~~\infty~~\Sigma~~ \\
  \neg~~\{~~+~~-~~!~~?~~0~~ \\
  x~~~(~~<~~\pi~~\sqrt{}~~\uint\\
  {\bf A}~~f~~\lxor~~\div~y~~~] \\
$$

We gather symbols into a collection called an _alphabet_.

> __~alphabet~.__ A finite set of symbols is called an _alphabet_, which we may arbitrarily denote as ${\Sigma}$. 

~example~. the set ${\set{0,1}}$ is an alphabet of two symbols, ${0}$ and ${1.}$

~example~. The alphabet ${\set{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}}$ is an alphabet of 10 symbols. This particular alphabet is called the _Hindu-Arabic numerals_, and each element of the set is called a _digit_.

> __~string~.__ A _string_ ${\sigma}$ of length ${n}$ is an ${n}$-tuple:
> 
> $$
> 	(a_i : {(i \neq n \nc i + 1) \land (1)})
> $$
> 
> where each ${a_i}$ is a member of some alphabet ${\Sigma.}$ That is, ${a_i \in \Sigma.}$ There exists a unique string where ${n=0,}$ which we call the _empty string_, denoted ${\lambda.}$ We say that the first symbol ${a_0}$ in ${\sigma}$ is the _first letter_ and the last symbol ${a_n}$ is the _last letter_. The set of all strings on the alphabet ${\Sigma}$ is the disjoint union:
> 
> $$
> 	\Sigma^* = \bigsqcup\limits_{n} A^n.
> $$

When we want to explicitly refer to a string divorced of all connotations, we will use question marks. For example, to denote the string _cookie_, we write ${\string{\text{cookie}}.}$ To denote the string 2518 we write: ${\string{2518}.}$

> __~concatenation~.__ Given the strings ${a = (a_1,\ldots,a_n)}$ and
> ${b=(b_1,\ldots,b_m)}$ on an alphabet ${\Sigma,}$ the concatenation ${ab \in
> \Sigma^*}$ is defined as:
> 
> $$
> 	ab = a_1, \ldots, a_mb_1, \ldots, b_n
> $$
> 
> Thus, we say that ${ab}$ is a string on ${\Sigma}$ of length ${m + n.}$ We define concatenation to be associative: ${(ab)c = a(bc)}$ for all ${a,b,c \in \Sigma^*.}$ We define the empty string ${\lambda}$ to be the identity element: ${\lambda a = a = a \lambda.}$ And we define concatenation to have two-sided cancellation: If ${ab=ac,}$ then ${b=c,}$ and if ${ac = bc,}$ then ${a=b.}$

### Propositions
We begin by defining our propositional alphabet:

> __~definition~.__ The set ${\Sigma}$ is the alphabet
> 
> $$
> 	\Sigma = \set{\top, \bot, \neg, \lor, \land} \cup \tav
> $$
> 
> where ${\tav}$ is a set containing all the Hindu-Arabic numerals, all the lower-case Greek letters, all the upper-case Greek letters, all the lower-case Roman letters, and all the upper-case Roman letters. Given an element of ${\tav,}$ we call such an element an _atom_, for which ${\top}$ or ${\bot}$ are assumed to be bound. The symbol ${\top}$ is read _true_. The symbol ${\bot}$ is read _false_. The symbol ${\neg}$ is read _not_. The symbol ${\lor}$ is read _or_. The symbol ${\land}$ is read _and_.

> __~definition~.__ Let ${\Sigma}$ be the alphabet ${\tav \cup \set{\top,~\bot,~\neg,~\lor,~\land}.}$ A _proposition_ ${\s}$ is a string on ${\Sigma}$ for which there exists a sequence ${(a_n) = \ax{a_1,\ldots,a_n}}$ with ${n \in \pint,}$ such that ${\s = S.}$ For each ${k \in \set{1,\ldots,n},}$ either ${\s_k \in \Sigma}$ or there are ${i,j \in \set{i,\ldots,k-1}}$ such that ${\s_k}$ is a member of the set of concatenations ${\set{\neg \s_i, \lor \s_i \s_j, \land \s_i, \s_j}.}$ We denote the set of propositions on ${\sigma}$ with the notation ${\df{prop}(\Sigma).}$

In short, the definition provides that a word is a string consisting only of symbols from our alphabet ${\Sigma,}$ with at least one of the following properties:

1. ${\s}$ is an atom.
2. ${\s}$ is ${\top.}$
3. ${\s}$ is ${\bot.}$
4. Where ${p}$ and ${q}$ are propositions, ${\s}$ is one of the propositions ${\neg p,}$ ${\lor pq,}$ or ${\land pq.}$ 

> __~lemma~.__ Let ${\set{x,y} \subseteq \df{prop}(\sigma).}$ If ${\len(x) = 1,}$ then ${x \in \set{\top,\bot}.}$ If ${\len(x) \gt 1,}$ then ${x_0 \in \set{\neg, \lor, \land}.}$ If ${x_0 = \neg,}$ then ${x = \neg y.}$ If ${x_0 = \lor,}$ then there exists a unique pair ${(x,y)}$ such that ${x = \lor x y.}$ If ${x_0 = \land,}$ then there exists a unique pairs ${(x,y)}$ such that ${x = \land x,y.}$

We're going to delay this lemma's proof until a later section. For now, note that we've defined propositions in prefix notation — ${\land pq}$ and ${\lor pq.}$ The benefit to prefix notation is that it follows naturally from our definitions. The cost, however, is readability. As such, we adopt the following convention without apology or compromise:

> __~convention~.__ Given a string ${\land ab,}$ we may denote the string as ${a \land b,}$ and given a string ${\lor ab,}$ we may denote the string as ${a \lor b.}$ Purely for readability, we may distinguish strings by inserting an abscissa before the first symbol in the string and by inserting an ordinate after the last symbol in the string, where the abscissa and ordinate belong to a an ordered pair from the set ${(\set{,}),(\ix{,}),(\px{,}).}$

We now state two primitive propositions.

__~or-proposition~.__ Let ${i,n \in \pint.}$ By the recursion theorem,

$$
	\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^{n} p_i = p_1 \lor \ldots \lor p_n = \case{
		\bot &\if ~ n = 0. \\
		p_1 &\if ~ n = 1. \\
		p_1 \lor p_2 &\if ~ n = 2. \\
		\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^{n}~ p_{i-1} \lor p_i &\if ~ n \gt 2. \\
	}
$$

__~and-proposition~.__ Let ${i,n \in \pint.}$ By the recursion theorem,

$$
	\bigwedge\limits_{i=1}^{n} p_i = p_1 \land \ldots \land p_n = \case{
		\top &\if ~ n = 0. \\
		p_1 &\if ~ n = 1. \\
		p_1 \land p_2 &\if ~ n = 2. \\
		\bigwedge\limits_{i=1}^{n}~ p_{i-1} \land p_i &\if ~ n \gt 2. \\
	}
$$

Alongside the definitions above, we adopt the following conventions.

> __~convention~.__ Let ${p,q,r \in \df{prop}(\Sigma).}$ Then by convention, we adopt the following notations:
> 
> $$
> 	\eqs{
> 		&p \lnand q& &\as& &\neg{p}\lor\neg{q}& \\
> 		&p \lnor q& &\as& &\neg{p}\land\neg{q}& \\
> 		&p \nc q& &\as&  &\neg p\lor q& \\
> 		&p \not\nc q& &\as&  &\neg(p \nc q)& \\
> 		&p \cn q& &\as&  &q \nc p& \\
> 		&p \not\cn q& &\as&  &\neg(q \nc p)& \\
> 		&p \iff q& &\as& &(p \cn q) \land (p \nc q)& \\
> 		&p \lxor q& &\as&  &\neg(p\iff q)& \\
> 	}
> $$
> where the notation ${\as}$ denotes ${\string{is defined as.}}$

## Boolean Functions
> __~definition~.__ A _Boolean function_ is a function ${t:\Sigma \mapsto \set{0,1}.}$ The function ${t}$ is extended to ${\hat{t}: \df{prop}(\Sigma) \mapsto \set{0,1}}$ provided all of following rules are complied with:
> 
> > ${\small{(\tx{i})}~}$ ${\hat{t}(\top)=1.}$
> > 
> > ${\small{(\tx{ii})}~}$ ${\hat{t}(\bot)=0.}$
> > 
> > ${\small{(\tx{iii})}~}$ ${\hat{t}(\neg p)= 1 - \hat{t}(p).}$
> >
> > ${\small{(\tx{iv})}~}$ ${\hat{t}(p \lor q) = \max{\set{\hat{t}(p),~\hat{t}(q)}}.}$
> >
> > ${\small{(\tx{v})}~}$ ${\hat{t}(p \land q) = \min{\set{\hat{t}(p),~\hat{t}(q)}}.}$
> 
> Purely for readability, we may write ${t}$ in lieu of ${\hat{t}.}$

We now proceed to proving various propositions about the Boolean functions.

### Implication
Logical implication takes the form _if ${p}$ then ${q,}$ which we denote as ${p \nc q.}$ We call ${p}$ the _sufficient condition_ and ${q}$ the _necessary condition_. In natural language, the logical implication manifests itself in a variety of forms:

<div className={`col2`}>

- if ${x}$ then ${y}$
- ${x}$ is sufficient for ${y}$
- if ${x,}$ ${y}$

<br/>

- ${y}$ when ${x}$
- a necessary condition for ${x}$ is ${y}$
- ${y}$ unless ${\neg x}$

<br/>

- ${x}$ implies ${y}$
- ${x}$ only if ${y}$
- ${y}$ whenever ${x}$
- ${y}$ follows from ${x}$

</div>

The only instance where an implication is false is when the sufficient condition is true and the necessary condition is false: ${\tx{true}\nc\tx{false}.}$ Outside of this case, the implication is _always true_.

## Models
Recall that a model is a set of sentences in a language that are _all true_.

> __~definition~.__ Let ${A \subseteq \df{prop}(\Sigma),}$ and let ${t: \Sigma \mapsto \set{0,1}.}$ Iff, for all propositions ${p \in A,}$ it follows that ${t(p)=1,}$ then we say that ${t}$ is a _model_ of ${A.}$ If, for every model of ${A,}$ it follows that ${t(p)=1,}$ then we say that ${p}$ is a _tautological consequence_ of ${A,}$ and write:
>
> $$
> 	A \models p.
> $$

## Predicates
Below are the basic rules of predicates we will want to formalize rigorously. Specifically, we seek to formally define what it means for an object to be "under consideration."

<Grid cols={2}>

> __~quantification~.__ The notation ${\P(x)}$ denotes: _the ${x}$ under consideration has the property ${\P.}$_

> __~universal quantification~.__ The notation ${\forall x \P(x)}$ denotes: _every ${x}$ under consideration has the property ${\P.}$_ That is, the conjunction:
>
> $$
> 	\bigwedge\limits_{i=1}^{n} \P(x_i) = \P(x_1) \land \P(x_2) \land \ldots \land \P(x_n).
> $$

> __~existential confirmation~.__ The notation ${\neg\forall x \P(x)}$ denotes: _not all ${x}$ under consideration have the property ${\P.}$_ We may also write ${\not\forall x \P(x).}$

> __~existential quantification~.__ The notation ${\exists x \P(x)}$ denotes: _there exists an ${x}$ under consideration that has the property ${\P.}$_ That is, the disjunction:
>
> $$
> 	\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^{n} \P(x_i) = \P(x_1) \lor \P(x_2) \lor \ldots \lor \P(x_n).
> $$

> __~universal denial~.__ The notation ${\neg\lex x \P(x)}$ denotes: _there does not exist an ${x}$ under consideration that has the property ${\P.}$_ We may also write ${\lnex x \P(x).}$

> __~uniqueness quantifier~.__ The notation ${!\lex x \P(x)}$ denotes: _there exists exactly one ${x}$, among all ${x}$s under consideration, that has the property ${\P.}$_
