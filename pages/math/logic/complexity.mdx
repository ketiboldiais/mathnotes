# Complexity

_This note covers basic concepts in the theory of computation._

Towards the early twentieth century, mathematicians grew increasingly concerned with the thought experiments philosophers cooked up. Most notably, Bertrand Russell demonstrated paradoxes in set theory. Debugging ensued, and for a brief period, peace prevailed. By this time, Richard Dedekind, Karl Weierstrass, and Giuseppe Peano had constructed a sufficiently robust axiomatic system (what we now know as the _Peano axioms_), and the mathematics community appeared ready to accept. True to form, the philosophers returned with a dish: The axioms were unsatisfactory because Gottlob Frege had shown that they could be reduced to even more primitive notions. A few mathematicians turned to Frege's system. But just as it began drawing in a few followers, the philosophers brought dessert: One of Frege's axioms led to a contradiction. Enter crisis.

Rising to the challenge, David Hilbert proposed a crisis management plan—_Hilbert's program_. In short, the objective was to construct an axiomatic system that ticked five boxes:

> ${\ws~~\df{i.}}$ __Formalism__. The system must be such that all mathematical statements can be written in a formal language.
>
> ${\ws~~\df{ii.}}$ __Completeness__. The system must show that all true mathematical statements can be proved in the formal language.
> 
> ${\ws~~\df{iii.}}$ __Consistency__. The system must show that there can be no proof of the statements ${p}$ and ${\neg p.}$
> 
> ${\ws~~\df{iv.}}$ __Conservation__. The system must show that "real statements" (e.g., computations and combinatorial manipulations) proved by abstract means, can also be proved without abstract means.
> 
> ${\ws~~\df{v.}}$ __Decidability__. The system must have a method of determining, in a finite number of steps, whether any given statement is true or false.

Hilbert's program returned a peculiar side-effect. Instead of a single, unified effort to meet these goals, Hilbert also met a growing crowd of logicians, mathematicians, and philosophers who were more interested in the _validity_ of his plan. Indeed, the moment we start discussing entities with such high precision, we have grounds for mathematical research—the systems themselves are mathematical objects. And where there are grounds for mathematical research, there are seedlings of a mathematical field. Today, that field has grown luscious enough to merit a name: _metamathematics_. Research in metamathematics, particularly with respect to consistency, completeness, and decidability, has pollinated other areas. Research into decidability (e.g., a subset of Alan Turing's work) ultimately led to the _theory of computation_.

## Automata
Computational problems can be organized in terms of which tools we can use to solve them. _Finite state machines_ are the simplest tool at our disposal. Harder problems can be solved with _context-free languages_, and yet others _Turing machines_. Some problems, however, are _undecidable_ — problems that cannot be solved with a machine.

## Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)
> __definition.__ A deterministic finite automata (DFA) is a pentuple ${\px{Q,\Sigma, q_0, F, \delta,}}$ where ${Q}$ is the set of all states, ${\Sigma}$ is a set of inputs, ${q_0}$ is an initial state, ${F}$ is a set of final states, and ${\delta}$ is a function (also called a _transition_) that takes a pair ${(S_1,I)}$ — a state and an input — and returns a state ${S_2 \in Q.}$

DFAs are machines with very limited memory.

In DFA diagrams, a double circle means “final state.” The labels atop, or beneath, each edge (the arrows between the circles) are outputs from the source state, sent as inputs to the next state. Comma separated inputs (e.g., `0,1`) mean “an input of either `0` or `1`.” Inputs that make their way to the final state are considered “successfully processed” or “good inputs,” whatever we’d like to call it for the task at hand. Loops on a circle mean “the input stays in this state.” If an input makes it to a circle with a loop, but that circle _is not_ the final state, then we call the circle the _dead state_ or _trap state_. Inputs that enter a dead state are considered “bad inputs” or “unsuccessfully processed,” again, whatever we’d like to call it, appropriate to the task. 

Consider the problem: Make a DFA that accepts any strings over `{a,b}` that _does not contain_ the string `aabb` in it. The obvious approach is to check whether every input string string contains `aabb`. But there’s one easier: Construct a DFA that _only accepts_ strings of the form `aabb`.
