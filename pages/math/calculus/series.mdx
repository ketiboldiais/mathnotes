# Series

This article covers notes on sums and series â€” a natural extension of the
fundamental theorem of calculus (FTC). As we saw, FTC tells us that we can
define functions as integrals. However, recall that integrals are also
expressions of adding up increasingly small rectangles. Accordingly,
integrals also provide a way of expressing cumulative sums, or **series**.
And where else have we seen series? Sequences. This presents some
interesting connections:
