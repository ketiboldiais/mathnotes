## Weighted Average

The idea of a weighted average is that we take the integral of some
function from ${a}$ to ${b,}$ and multiply it by some _weight_, and divide
it by the total weighting:

$$
 \dfrac
 {\displaystyle \integral{a}{b} f(x) \cdot w(x)~dx}
 {\displaystyle \integral{a}{b} w(x) dx}
$$

This definition isn't that unusual. Think about the average we computed in
grade school. We have some list of values:

$$
 \seq{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, \ldots, v_n}
$$

and we divide the sum of all these values by the number of terms:

$$
 \dfrac
  {v_1 + v_2 + v_3 + v_4 + \ldots + v_n}
  {n}
$$

This is the _discrete version_ of an average — what we know as the
_arithmetic mean_. The _continuous version_ of an average is the definition
above: a _weighted average_. Of note, many statistics textbooks often
define the weighted average as:

$$
 \overline{x}_{wtd} = \dfrac
  {\dsum{i=1}{n} w_i x_i}
  {\dsum{i=1}{n} w_i}
$$

The notion of a weighted average brings us to one of the most important
applications of integration in the modern era: probability.

## Probability

Suppose we had the following graph:

<Plot data={[
  {f:(x)=>1-x**2}
]}
domain={[-2,2]}
range={[0,1.5]}
scale={70}
/>

if we picked a point "at random" in the region ${0 \ltn y \ltn 1-x^2,}$ what is
the probability that ${x \gtn \frac{1}{2}?}$ Casting this question in
probability terms, this question asks for the probability:

$$
  \P \paren{x \gtn \frac{1}{2}}
$$

From the perspective of calculus, a probability is simply a special kind of
ratio. Specifically, a ratio of the part of something to the whole of something:

$$
  \dfrac{\tt{part}}{\tt{whole}}
$$

The part that we're interested in:

<Plot data={[
  {f:(x)=>1-x**2, integrate:[0.5,1,`x`]}
]}
domain={[-2,2]}
range={[0,1.5]}
scale={70}
/>

This is a straightforward integration problem. That area is:

$$
  \dfrac{\displaystyle \int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{1} 1-x^2 ~dx}
  {\displaystyle \int_{-1}^{1} 1-x^2 ~dx}
$$

As we saw with the weighted average, the weighting factor here is:

$$
  w(x) = 1-x^2
$$

And just to be more explicit, our starting point is ${-1,}$ and our ending point
is ${b = 1.}$ Working out the computation, we get:

$$
  \P \paren{x \gtn \frac{1}{2}} = \dfrac{5}{32}
$$

We can generalize this computation with the following formula:

$$
  \P(x_1 \ltn x \ltn x_2) 
  = 
  \dfrac
  {\tt{part}}
  {\tt{whole}}
  =
  \dfrac
  {\displaystyle \int_{x_1}^{x_2} w(x) ~ dx}
  {\displaystyle \int_{a}^{b} w(x) ~ dx}
$$

Let's consider an example taken from the real world. Suppose we're on a manhunt
for a wanted criminal. We've narrowed down their possible location to the
following:

<Plot2 
  geo={[
    {type:"circle", xy:[0,0], r:4, class:`redCircle`},
    {type:"circle", xy:[0,0], r:6, class: `blueCircle`},
    {type:"ray", start:[0,0], end:[3.5,0]},
    {type:"ray", start:[0,0], end:[0,5.5]},
    {type:`label`, xy:[0.5,3], id:`r_2`,fontSize:1.1},
    {type:`label`, xy:[2,-0.05], id:`r_1`,fontSize:1.1},
  ]}
  noAxes={true}
  scale={70}
/>

The question: What are the odds that the crook is somewhere in the blue region?
To simplify our computation, we make the following assumption:

<dfn>

The number of hits is proportional to ${ce^{-r^2},}$ where ${c}$ is a constant,
${e}$ is Euler's number, and ${r}$ is the radius.

</dfn>

This assumption effectively states that the number of hits is a normal
distribution in terms of a given a radius. To understand what this assumption
implies, let's take a look at the plot of the function ${f = e^{-r^2}.}$

<Plot data={[
  {f:(x) => Math.E ** (-1 * (x ** 2))}
]}
domain={[-4,4]}
range={[-0.5,1.2]}
scale={70}
axesLabels={[`radius`,`hits`]}
margins={[50,50,50,50]}
ticks={0}
id={`ia0`}
/>

Suppose that, instead of a manhunt, we were throwing darts. When we make the
assumption above, we're stating that, if we threw millions of darts, more of
them would land closer to the middle (the _top of the bell curve_), and fewer of
them would land towards the lower and upper ends.

Question: Why specifically do we use the function ${f = e^{-r^2}?}$ Why not some
other function? This is probability question rather than a calculus question, so
we won't answer it in detail (it's akin to asking why we would use one kinematic
equation over another given a physics problem). It's simply the most accurate
model for our purposes. When the Germans bombed London during the Second World
War, the British miliary found that among all the possible functions they could
use to predict where the bombs might land, the function ${f = e^{-r^2}}$ proved
to be the most accurate.

That said, it's important to note some nuances to the model (the graph of ${f =
e^{-r^2}}$). The model isn't saying that, if everyone in the world threw darts,
they'd hit the bullseye. What it's saying is, if everyone in the world threw
darts, many more of them would be closer to the bullseye than further
(otherwise, no one would play darts). In other words, there's a difference
between the most likely place to hit (the _mode_) and what happens on _average_.

Viewed this way, the area we're interested in is the area between ${r_1}$ and
${r_2,}$ _rotated_ (rotated because the actual area is a circle):

<Grid cols={2}>

<Plot data={[ {f:(x) => Math.E ** (-1 * (x ** 2)), integrate:[0.8,1.4,`x`]}, ]}
domain={[-4,4]} range={[-0.5,1.2]} scale={100} axesLabels={[`radius`,`hits`]}
margins={[50,50,50,50]} ticks={0} id={`ia1`} />

<Fig

imwidth={"268"} imheight={"251"} caption={"70"} width={"70"} />

</Grid>



We can find this area through the _method of shells_. Our bounds are ${r_1}$ and ${r_2:}$

$$
  \int_{r_1}^{r_2} \iff r_1 \ltn r=x \ltn r_2
$$

Next, we know that the circumference of a circle is given by ${C = 2 \pi r.}$
This gives us our first term:

$$
  \int_{r_1}^{r_2} (2 \pi r)
$$

Now we need the height (since the figure is rotated). This height is given by
the plot's function: 

$$
  \int_{r_1}^{r_2} (2 \pi r) \cdot e^{-r^{2}}
$$

then we multiply by the thickness of the plot:

$$
  \int_{r_1}^{r_2} (2 \pi r) \cdot e^{-r^{2}}~~dr
$$

Expanding the integral for evaluation:

$$
  \eqs{
    \int_{r_1}^{r_2} (2 \pi r) \cdot e^{-r^{2}}~~dr &= \deval{-\pi e^{-r^2}}{r_1}{r_2} \\[1em]
    &= \pi (e^{-{r_1}^2} - e^{-{r_2}^2})
  }
$$

This gives us the part:

$$
  \tt{part} = c \pi (e^{-{r_1}^2} - e^{-{r_2}^2})
$$

Notice that we attached a constant ${c}$ to the expression. Why? Because the
crook could be any sector of the blue region. By attaching the constant ${c,}$
we account for the situation where it takes ${c}$ attempts to get to the right
sector.

Now we want the whole. To find the whole, we assume that ${r}$ can range from ${0}$ to infinity.

$$
  0 \lte r \ltn \infty
$$

We accomplish two things by making this assumption: (1) We cover all of the
possible values of ${r}$ that are relevant to our analysis, and (2) we get the
whole in numeric form much more cleanly. If ${r}$ lies in this range, then the
whole is simply taking the part to the limits:

$$
  \eqs{
    \tt{part} &= c \pi (\ll{r_1}{0} e^{-{r_1}^2} - \ll{r_2}{\infty} e^{-{r_2}^2}) \\[1em]
    &= c \pi (1 - 0) \\[1em]
    &= c \pi (1) \\[1em]
    &= c \pi
  }
$$

The probability of finding the crook in the blue region, then, is:

$$
  \eqs{
    \P (r_1 \ltn r \ltn r_2) = \dfrac{\tt{part}}{\tt{whole}} &= \dfrac{c \pi (e^{-{r_1}^2} - e^{-{r_2}^2})}{c \pi} \\[1em]
    &= \dfrac{\cancel{c} \cancel{\pi} (e^{-{r_1}^2} - e^{-{r_2}^2})}{\cancel{c} \cancel{\pi}} \\[1em]
    &= e^{-{r_1}^2} - e^{-{r_2}^2}
  }
$$

## Numerical Integration

Many integrals do not have formulas and require evaluation by a computer.
Computers achieve these computations through _numerical integration_. There are
several approaches to performing numerical integration. Let's examine each approach.

### Riemann Summation

One approach is to compute as many rectangles beneath the curve as possible.
I.e., the _Riemann Sum_.

<Fig
link={"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1662920600/math/riemann_sum_numeric_integration_anmqqr.svg"}
imwidth={"253"} imheight={"337"} caption={"Riemann sum"} width={"45"} />

With the Riemann Sum approach, the ${\Delta x}$ is the increment value of the
for-loop. That gives us the width of our rectangles:

$$
  (a=x_0) \ltn x_1 \ltn x_2 \ltn \ldots \ltn (x_n = b) 
$$

The height of each rectangle is given by the evaluating the function at each ${x_i,}$ where ${i = 0,1,2,\ldots,n:}$

$$
  f(x_0), f(x_1), f(x_2), \ldots f(x_n)
$$

The approximated integral, then, is simply:

$$
  (f(x_0) + f(x_1) + f(x_2) + \ldots + f(x_{n-1})) \cdot \Delta x
$$

This is the _left-hand approach_ (the rectangle's upper left-hand corner marks
the end of the rectangle's upward growth). We could also use the _right-hand_
and _midpoint_ approaches alternatively:

<Fig
  link={"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1662923186/math/riemann_sum_approachs_kmprdz.svg"}
  imwidth={"627"}
  imheight={"231"}
  caption={"approaches"}
  width={"100"}
/>

The differences between these approaches comes down to which ${x}$ we want the
height evaluated for. With the right-hand approach, the expression changes to:

$$
  (f(x_1) + f(x_2) + f(x_3) + \ldots + f(x_{n})) \cdot \Delta x
$$

The midpoint approach is a little more elaborate, and requires computing the halfway point between ${x_{i-1}}$ and ${x_i:}$

$$
  \small
  \paren{f \paren{\dfrac{x_1 - x_0}{2}} + f \paren{\dfrac{x_2 - x_1}{2}} +  f
  \paren{\dfrac{x_3 - x_2}{2}} + \ldots + f \paren{\dfrac{x_{n} -
  x_{n-1}}{2}}}\cdot \Delta x
$$

The problem with all of these approaches — or, more generally, the Riemann Sum
approach — is that it's terribly inefficient in practice. Not only must we loop
through an interval that could potentially comprise thousands of ${x}$s, we must
also evaluate a potentially complicated function with those ${x}$s.

### Trapezoidal Rule

An alternative approach is the _Trapezoidal Rule_. This approach can be thought
of as a variation of the Riemann Sum. The primary difference being we
approximate the area with trapezoids rather than rectangles.

<Fig
link={"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1662925343/math/trapezoid_rule_rfzzz6.svg"}
imwidth={"252"} imheight={"337"} caption={"trapezoid rule"} width={"45"} />

The area for each trapezoid is given by the expression:

$$
  \Delta x \paren{\dfrac{f(x_{i-1}) + f(x_{i})}{2}}
$$

The approximated area, then, is the sum of all these trapezoids:

$$
  \Delta x \paren{  \dfrac{y_0 + y_1}{2} + \dfrac{y_1 + y_2}{2} + \ldots +
  \dfrac{y_{n-2} + y_{n-1}}{2} + \dfrac{y_{n-1} - y_n}{2}}
$$

where ${y_i, i = 0,1,2,\ldots,n}$ is the height of each trapezoid:

$$
  y_i = \dfrac{f(x_{i-1}) + f(x_{i})}{2}
$$

This sum can be further simplified:

$$
  \Delta x \paren{ \dfrac{y_0}{2} + y_1 + y_2 + \ldots + y_{n-1} + \dfrac{y_n}{2}}
$$

The term ${\dfrac{y_1 + y_2}{2}}$ reduces to ${y_1}$ because half of ${y_1}$
appears twice in the expression. This reduction continues throughout the
expression until the very last, ${y_n}$ (there's no other half of ${y_n}$).

If we think about the trapezoidal rule a little more carefully, we'd realize
that it's just the average of the left-hand Riemann sum and the right-hand
Riemann sum. Geometrically, that average removes the overlap caused by
approximating areas with rectangles.

While the trapezoidal rule returns a better approximated area, it still suffers
from the inefficiency we saw with Riemann sums. A better approach is Simpson's
Rule.


### Simpson's Rule

With Simpson's Rule, we still iterate over an interval. The difference, however,
is that we focus on two pairs of shapes, rather than the rectangle-by-rectangle
approach we saw with Riemann sums and the trapezoid-by-trapezoid approach with
the trapezoid rule. We do this by having a parabola pass through three points:

<Fig
  link={"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1662929756/math/simpsons_rule_pyzhi8.svg"}
  imwidth={"337"}
  imheight={"220"}
  caption={"Simpson's Rule"}
  width={"80"}
/>

The three points — marked above as ${y_0,}$ ${y_1,}$ and ${y_2}$ — lie on the
parabola, with ${y_0}$ and and ${y_2}$ equidistance from ${y_1.}$

The area beneath this parabola is the approximation we want. Looking at the
diagram above, it's not apparent that this is a good approximation, given how
much over lap there is. However, if we made ${\Delta x}$ small enough, we'd find
that it's actually a very good approximation, especially when we consider the
fact that most real-world functions have few inflection points (relative to
modern computing power).

Let's say the blue curve above is the plot of some function ${f(x),}$ and the
parabola passing through the points ${y_0,}$ ${y_1,}$ and ${y_2}$ is the
function ${p(x).}$ We want the area beneath ${p(x):}$ 

$$
  \int_{a}^{b} p(x) ~dx
$$

Since ${a}$ and ${b}$ are equidistant from one another, we can denote them as:

$$
  a = -h \\
  b = h
$$

Therefore, the area beneath ${p(x)}$ is given by the integral:

$$
  \int_{-h}^{h} p(x) ~dx
$$

Since the plot of ${p(x)}$ is a parabola, we know that ${p(x)}$ is a quadratic
function:

$$
  p(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + C
$$

where ${A,}$ ${B,}$ and ${C}$ are constants. Expanding the integral:

$$
  \eqs{
    \int_{-h}^{h} p(x) ~dx &= \int_{-h}^{h} Ax^2 + Bx + C ~dx \\[1em]
    &= \deval{\dfrac{Ax^3}{3} + \dfrac{Bx^2}{2} + Cx}{-h}{h}
  }
$$

Now let's evaluate. The first thing to note is that the ${B}$ term isn't
necessary. This is because ${Ax^2}$ and ${C}$ are both even functions, and we're
integrating over an area that's symmetric (we're going from ${-h}$ to ${h}$).
Thus, we get the following evaluation:

$$
  \eqs{
    \deval{\dfrac{Ax^3}{3} + \dfrac{Bx^2}{2} + Cx}{-h}{h} = \dfrac{2Ah^3}{3} + 2Ch
  }
$$

So, we now have the expression:

$$
  \dfrac{2Ah^3}{3} + 2Ch
$$

We want to rewrite this expression to be purely in terms of what we're given.
Namely, ${y_0,}$ ${y_1,}$ and ${y_2.}$ Let's factor out one of the ${h}$s to get
closer to a parabola:

$$
  \dfrac{h}{3} \paren{ 2Ah^2 + 6C  }
$$

To get our terms ${y_0,}$ ${y_1,}$ and ${y_2,}$ we plug them into our
original. Why are we allowed to do this? Because all three points lie on the
parabola.

$$
	\eqs{
    p(h) &= Ah^2 + Bh + C = y_2 \\
    p(-h) &= Ah^2 - Bh + C = y_0
  }
$$

Using the facts above, we can infer that:

$$
  \eqs{
    y_2 + y_0 &= Ah^2 + Bh + C + Ah^2 - Bh + C \\
    &= 2Ah^2 + 2C
  }
$$

We can now see the terms we want. Let's isolate them:

$$
  2Ah^2 = y_0 + y_2 - 2C
$$

What do we do about that ${2C}$ term? Well, if we returned to our diagram, we'd
find that ${C}$ is actually ${y_1.}$ Remember, ${p(x)}$ is a parabola. Thus, we
have:

$$
  2Ah^2 = y_0 + y_2 - 2y_1
$$

Rewriting our evaluated integral with our newly-inferred facts:

$$
  \dfrac{h}{3} \paren{ y_0 + y_2 - 2y_1 + 6y_1 } = \dfrac{h}{3} \paren{y_0 +
  4y_1 + y_2}
$$

Thus, Simpson's Rule tells us:

$$
  \int_{a}^{b} f(x)~dx \approx \dfrac{b-a}{3} \paren{ f(a) + 4 f \paren{\dfrac{a+b}{2}} + f(b) } 
$$

### Caveats to Numerical Integration

Remember that numerical integration techniques are all still subject to the laws
of calculus. This may seem trivial to say, but it's very easy to forget these
laws when we're deep into writing or debugging some program. In particular,
numerical integration techniques fail for non-smooth functions. This shouldn't
be surprising — chances are, those non-smooth functions are non-differentiable.
The techniques also go awry for rational functions where the denominator starts
approaching perilously close to 0. At those values, the approximation is
essentially a blackbox and all bets are off: Whatever values we get will depend
on how the programming language handles division by zero.

Additionally, numerical integration techniques are subject to the problems of
floating point arithmetic. Even the most sophisticated computer algebra systems
can have difficulty with certain integrals. All of these caveats demonstrate
that before we ever carry out a computation, we must be certain about both the
mathematical principles at play, alongside the limitations of modern
computation.
