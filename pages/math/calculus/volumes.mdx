This section covers notes on volumes.

## Volumes By Slicing

Given a 3D figure, we can compute the volume by slicing it (i.e., taking a
cross-section) into smaller and smaller pieces. If we denote the area of
the face as ${A,}$ we can express the volume as:

$$
	\Delta V \approx A \Delta x
$$

Couching it in calculus terms:

$$
	dV = A(x) dx
$$

The entire volume is thus:

$$
	V = \int A(x) dx
$$
