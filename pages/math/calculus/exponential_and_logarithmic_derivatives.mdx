# Derivatives of Exponentials & Logarithmics

We now turn to differentiating exponential and logarithmic functions.
Knowing how to compute the derivatives for these functions is especially
useful in applied mathematics fields. For example, we frequently see
exponential functions with future value calculations in finance, and
logarithmic functions for discounting to present value. We also see
exponential functions in population growth models. In all of these
situations, knowing how to compute various rates of change is invaluabe.
And as we've seen, that knowledge is provided through the derivative.

We begin by recalling some of the basic rules of exponents. First, where
${a, b > 0,}$ the following rules hold:

> _Exponent-product Rule_. The exponential of the sum is the exponential of
> the product:
>
> $$
> 	a^{x_1} \cdot a^{x_2} = a^{x_1 + x_2}

>
> where ${a \in \ZZ^{+},}$ ${x_1, x_2 \in \ZZ.}$

> _Exponent-quotient Rule_. If the bases are the same, keep the base and
> subtract the exponent in the denominator from the exponent in the
> numerator.
>
> $$
> 	\dfrac{a^{x_1}}{a^{x_2}} = a^{x_1 - x_2} = \dfrac{1}{a^{x_2 - x_1}}
> $$
>
> where ${a \in \ZZ^{+},}$ ${x_1, x_2 \in \ZZ.}$

> _Raising a Product to a Power_. To raise a product to the

Keeping these rules in mind, let's see some functions. How about
${f(x) = 2^x:}$

To find the derivative of this function, let's think about how Newton's
quotient applies. It would look something like this:

$$
	f'(x) = \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{a^{x + \Delta x} -a^x}{\Delta x}
$$

What should we do next? Look at the term ${a^{x + \Delta x} -a^x.}$ We can
rewrite this term as ${(a^{x})(a^{\Delta x}).}$ Incorporation this rewrite:

$$
	f'(x) = \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{(a^{x})(a^{\Delta x})- a^x}{\Delta x}
$$

Now we see a common factor we can factor out, ${a^x}$:

$$
	\begin{aligned} f'(x) &= \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{(a^{x})(a^{\Delta x})- a^x}{\Delta x} \\[1em] &= \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} (a^x) \left(\dfrac{a^{\Delta x} - 1}{\Delta x}\right) \end{aligned}
$$

At this point, we have something to work with conceptually. Let's recall
how the limit ${\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0}}$ applies here. With this
limit, we know that: (1) ${a}$ is fixed, and (2) ${x}$ is fixed. Because of
these two facts, it follows that ${a^x}$ is constant. And because ${a^x}$
is constant, we can factor it out of the limit &mdash; it has no bearing on
our analysis of the limit:

$$
	f'(x) = a^x \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{a^{\Delta x} - 1}{\Delta x}
$$

Thus, our analysis is really focused on what the limit term is. Because of
how important the term is, we'll write this expression as:

$$
	f'(x) = a^x \cdot L(a)
$$

where:

$$
	L(a) = \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{a^{\Delta x} - 1}{\Delta x}
$$

So, what exactly is ${L(a)?}$ To begin, we state an observation. If we plug
in the value ${x = 0,}$ we get:

$$
	\left. \dfrac{d}{dx} a^x \right\vert_{x = 0} = a^0 \cdot L(a) = 1 \cdot L(a) = L(a)
$$

This observation tells us that at ${x = 0,}$ the slope of ${a^x}$ is this
limit we're calling ${L(a).}$ More specifically, since ${a = 2,}$ we have a
slope of ${L(2)}$ (at ${x = 0.}$) This tells us that if we instead had the
function ${f(x) = 3^x,}$ at ${x = 0}$ we'd get ${L(3).}$ For
${f(x) = 13^x,}$ at ${x = 0}$ we'd get ${L(13),}$ and so on. This leads to
a broader observation: If we know the slope at ${x = 0}$ for some function
${f(x) = a^x,}$ we can determine the slope everywhere else. We've seen this
phenomenon before with sines and cosines: We knew the slope for sine and
cosine at ${x = 0,}$ and from the trigonometric formulas, we determined the
slope everywhere else.

The difference with exponentials: we're stuck right off the bat. With sine
and cosine, we had the benefit of using radians, which allowed us to
interpret the limits geometrically. Here, we're dealing directly with a
number. There are no clever shortcuts to rely on. So we're going to need a
different tactic. In this case, we're going to _beg the
question_.[^note_beg_the_question]

[^note_beg_the_question]:
    &#8220;Begging the question&#8221; is a type of informal fallacy.
    Essentially, smuggling the conclusion into our premises. For example:
    God must exist. How do you know? Because the Bible says so. Why should
    I believe the Bible? Because the Bible was written by God. Another
    example: The belief in God is universal. After all, everyone believes
    in God. Begging the question is not a logical fallacy. Arguments that
    beg the question are logically valid. These arguments, however, are
    typically unpersuasive (as seen in the preceding examples), but they
    are perfectly logical. In other words, we're going to go at this
    problem in a roundabout way. This is a circuitous approach, not
    circular. Effectively, we're going to refuse to answer &#8220;What is
    ${L(a)?}$&#8221; directly for now, but we will eventually get to the
    question.

We start by stating a proposition:

> There exists a base ${e,}$ where ${e}$ is a unique real number, such that
> ${M(e) = 1.}$

From the proposition above, we have the following:

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x
$$

This is a very important deduction (so much so that we will encapsulate it
in a formal definition later). Furthermore, from our previous analysis, we
know that:

$$
	\left. \frac{d}{dx} e^x \right\vert_{x = 0} = 1
$$

As we're all too familiar with in mathematics, we should never take things
for granted. Why does ${e}$ exist? How do we know it exists? So we know
that ${f(x) = 2^x}$ exists. That is, after all, what we started with.
Furthermore, we know that it has the property ${f'(0) = L(2).}$ Now let's
say we stretch the function ${f(x) = 2^x.}$ We can stretch this function by
multiplying its inputs with a factor ${k}$:

$$
	f(kx) = 2^{kx}
$$

By the exponent power rule, the expression ${2^{kx}}$ is the same as
${(2^k)^x.}$ And since ${2}$ and ${k}$ are both real numbers, ${2^k}$ is a
real number, which we can denote as ${b = 2^x.}$ This means we can rewrite
the function above as:

$$
	f(kx) = b^x, \space \space \space (b = 2^k)
$$

Now, what happens when we shrink a function's graph? Well, we essentially
shrink the ${x}$-axis, which in turn leads to the graph's slope tilting up.
Thus, as ${k \to \texttt{+}\infty}$ (${k}$ gets bigger and bigger), the
slope of ${f(kx)}$ gets steeper and steeper. This is numerically confirmed
by considering the derivative of ${f(kx):}$

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx} b^x = \dfrac{d}{dx}f(kx) = k \cdot f'(kx)
$$

Evaluating at ${0:}$

$$
	\left. \dfrac{d}{dx} b^x \right\vert_{x = 0} = k \cdot f'(0) = k \cdot L(2)
$$

At this point, we know that ${e}$ exists. When ${k = \dfrac{1}{L(2)},}$ we
have:

$$
	\left. \dfrac{d}{dx} b^x \right\vert_{x = 0} = k \cdot f'(0) = \dfrac{1}{L(2)} \cdot L(2) = 1
$$

Substitute ${e}$ into ${b,}$ the equation holds true: ${e^0 = 1.}$ And
since the equation holds true, we know that ${e}$ exists.

Knowing that ${e}$ exists, we can continue with our derivative. We must now
put all of these observations together. To do so, we rely on a particularly
useful operation in mathematics: The natural logarithm. The natural log is
defined as such:

$$
	y = e^x \iff \ln y = x
$$

The natural logarithm has several useful properties that are worth
revisiting:

- ${\ln (x_1 \cdot x_2) = \ln x_1 + \ln x_2}$
- ${\ln 1 = 0}$
- ${\ln e = 1}$

And just to reminder ourselves, the graphs of ${f(x) = e^x}$ and
${g(x) = \ln x:}$

<Fig

/>

With the graphs above, we can see that ${g(x) = \ln x}$ is indeed the
inverse of ${f(x) = e^x.}$ We're switching the roles of ${x}$ and ${y.}$
Notice further that ${g(x) = \ln x}$ is only defined when ${x > 0.}$ This
corresponds to the fact that ${f(x) = e^x}$ is always positive.

Since ${g(x) = \ln x}$ is the inverse function of ${f(x) = \ln x,}$ we can
use implicit differentiation to find the derivative of the natural
logarithm. To do so, we'll write ${w = \ln x.}$ We want to find the
derivative of ${w.}$ But we don't know how, so what we'll do is
exponentiate:

$$
	w = \ln x \implies e^w = x \implies e^{\ln x} = x
$$

Given that ${w = e^{\ln x} = x,}$ we can differentiate:

$$
	\begin{aligned} \dfrac{d} {dx} e^w &= \dfrac{d} {dx} x \\[1em] &= 1 \end{aligned}
$$

Applying implicit differentiation, we have:

$$
	\begin{align*} \left( \dfrac{d}{dx} e^w \right)\left( \dfrac{dw}{dx} \right) &= 1\\[1em] \left( e^w \right)\left( \dfrac{dw}{dx} \right) &= 1\\[1em] \dfrac{dw}{dx} &= \dfrac{1}{e^w} \end{align*}
$$

Substitute ${w}$ with ${\ln x}$ (since we defined ${w = \ln x}$):

$$
	\begin{align*} \dfrac{dw}{dx} &= \dfrac{1}{e^{\ln x}} \\[1em] &= \dfrac{1}{x} \\ \end{align*}
$$

Hence, we have the following:

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx} \ln x = \dfrac{1}{x}
$$

We now have two formulas to work with:

- ${(e^x)' = e^x}$
- ${(\ln x)' = \dfrac{1}{x}}$

We now return to our pesky function ${y = a^x.}$ If we can find the
derivative for this function, we can find the derivative for any
exponential function. Knowing the two formulas above, we can compute the
derivative by first rewriting ${a^x}$ in terms of base ${e.}$ I.e.,
converting ${a^x}$ into base ${e.}$ How do we convert ${a^x}$ to ${e^x?}$
We want to write ${a^x}$ as ${e^{?}.}$ In other words, ${e}$ to some power:

$$
	a^x = (e^{\ln a})^x = e^{x \ln a}
$$

Now we can carry out the differentiation:

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx}a^x = \dfrac{d}{dx} e^{x \ln a}
$$

The first step is often a point of great confusion, so it's critical that
we are comfortable with it as possible. First, we emphasize that ${e}$ and
${\ln a}$ are constants. They're fixed. No movement. The only thing that's
moving is ${x.}$ If we were asked to compute the derivative of ${e^{2x,}}$
the derivative would look like:

$$
	(e^{2x})' = 2e^{2x}
$$

by the chain rule. The same idea applies to the derivative of
${e^{x \ln a}.}$ Hence:

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx}a^x = \dfrac{d}{dx} e^{x \ln a} = (\ln a)e^{x \ln a}
$$

We know that ${e^{x \ln a} = a^x,}$ so we have the derivative of ${a^x:}$

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx} a^x = (\ln a)a^x
$$

Now we can go back to our very first problem: ${y = 2^x.}$ Recall we asked,
what exactly is ${L(a)?}$ Well now have it:

$$
	L(a) = \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{a^{\Delta x} - 1}{\Delta x} = \ln a
$$

Accordingly, we have:

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx} 2^x = (\ln 2)2^x
$$

Similarly:

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx} 10^x = (\ln 10)10^x
$$

This is one of the reasons for why the natural logarithm takes as part of
its name the adjective &#8220;natural.&#8221; No matter what base we
choose, the respective exponential function's derivative will contain a
natural logarithm. It's a logarithm that appears without any reference.

## Logarithmic Differentiation

In the method above, we arrived at the derivative of ${y = a^x}$ by
rewriting the base in terms of ${e.}$ There is, however, any way to compute
the derivative: through the method of logarithmic differentiation.

With logarithmic differentiation, rather than directly computing the
derivative of some function ${u,}$ we instead attempt to compute the
derivative of its logarithm. More explicitly, instead of computing:

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx} u
$$

we instead compute:

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx} \ln u
$$

Applying the chain rule:

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx} \ln u = \left(\dfrac{d \ln u}{du}\right) \dfrac{du}{dx}
$$

Note that the expression ${\dfrac{d \ln u}{du}}$ just another way to write
${\dfrac{d}{du} \ln u.}$ We know that this term evaluates to
${\dfrac{1}{u},}$ so we have:

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx} \ln u = \dfrac{1}{u} \dfrac{du}{dx}
$$

This is the controlling principle of logarithmic differentiation. We state
it explicitly:

$$
	(\ln u)' = \dfrac{u'}{u}
$$

Applying this to ${\dfrac{d}{dx} a^x:}$

$$
	\left. \dfrac{d}{dx}a^x \right\vert_{u = a^x} = \ln u = x \ln a
$$

And as we know from our rules, ${(\ln u)' = \ln a.}$ Why? Because ${\ln a}$
is just a constant. It doesn't move. Performing the rest of the
computation:

$$
	\dfrac{u'}{u} = (\ln u)' = \ln a
$$

Solving for ${u':}$

$$
	u' = u \ln a
$$

Substituting ${u = a^x:}$

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx} a^x = (\ln a)a^x
$$

We get the same derivative we saw with the rewriting-in-terms-of-${e}$
method. Logarithmic differentiation allows us to compute even more complex
derivatives. Consider the function:

$$
	(y = x ^ x)
$$

This is a fairly nasty function. It's got both a moving base and a moving
exponent. Once more, we apply logarithmic differentiation. First, we
express ${x^x}$ as a variable:

$$
	(v = x ^ x)
$$

Next, we rewrite the expression as a logarithm:

$$
	\ln v = x \ln x
$$

Then we compute the derivative:

$$
	\begin{align*} (\ln v)' &= \ln x + x \left( \dfrac{1}{x} \right) \\[1em] &= 1 + \ln x \end{align*}
$$

Accordingly, we now have:

$$
	\dfrac{v'}{v} = 1 + \ln x
$$

Solving for ${v':}$

$$
	v' = v(1 + \ln x)
$$

Substituting with ${v = x^x,}$ we have the following rule:

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx} x^x = x^x(1 + \ln x)
$$

## Euler's Number

Having seen how the natural logarithm is so useful, we now turn to a closer
look at the number ${e.}$ After all, this entire discussion has been
premised on the existence of ${e,}$ and although we proved that it existed,
we didn't delve any deeper. We do so now.

What does this limit evaluate to:

$$
	\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^n
$$

Evaluating this limit, we have:

$$
	\ln \left( \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^n \right) = n \ln \left( 1 - \dfrac{1}{n} \right)
$$

Let's rewrite this expression in a more recognizable form. Suppose
${\Delta x = \dfrac{1}{n}.}$ This means that as ${n}$ tends to infinity (as
our expression provies), ${\Delta x}$ tends to zero. Rewriting the
expression:

$$
	\ln \left( \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^n \right) = n \ln \left( 1 - \dfrac{1}{n} \right) = \dfrac{1}{\Delta x}\ln(1 + \Delta x)
$$

Now we perform the classic trick of subtracting ${0}$ from the expression.
In this case, we will represent ${0}$ as ${\ln 1:}$

$$
	\ln \left( \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^n \right) = n \ln \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right) = \dfrac{1}{\Delta x}(\ln(1 + \Delta x) - \ln 1)
$$

Do we see the pattern in the last expression? Let's rewrite it one more
time:

$$
	\dfrac{\ln(1 + \Delta x) - \ln 1}{\Delta x}
$$

This is just an application of Newton's Quotient. It's the expression we
get from computing:

$$
	\left. \dfrac{d}{dx} \ln x \right\vert_{x = 1}
$$

And we know the result of this computation:

$$
	\left. \dfrac{d}{dx} \ln x \right\vert_{x = 1} = \left. \dfrac{1}{x} \right\vert_{x = 1} = 1
$$

Finally, given ${x = 1,}$ the limit evaluates to ${1.}$ Now we just have to
work backwards to determine our original limit,
${\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} (1 + \frac{1}{n}).}$ First, we remind
ourselves of the limit we just computed:

$$
	\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \ln \left( \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^n \right) = 1
$$

This is the limit of the natural logarithm of our original expression. To
evaluate our original limit, we must &#8220;undo&#8221; the natural
logarithm. And how do we do so? Be rewriting the natural logarithm in terms
of its inverse: a power with the base ${e:}$

$$
	\Large \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^n = e^{^{\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \ln \left( \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \right)}}
$$

Note that this isn't anything new. We're just undoing what we've done. The
limit of the log is equal to the log of the limit. And given that we've
solved for the limit of the log, we see ${e}$ in all its glory:

$$
	\Large \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^n = e^{^{\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \ln \left( \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \right)}} = e^1 = e
$$

This is such an important result, that we must state it from a different
perspective:

$$
	e = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^n
$$

As an aside, notice that reading the equation the other way leads to
another key insight: An approximation of ${e.}$ In mathematics, we should
always read our equations (and really, any proposition) both
&#8220;forward&#8221; and &#8220;backward&#8221;. If we have equality,
rewrite it from both directions. Inequality, state it in terms of what's
less and what's greater. A conditional, state the contrapositive. Switching
perspectives is the first step towards greater insight.

## Power Functions

Recall our rule for computing the derivative of a power function:

$$
	(x^n)' = n \cdot x^{n-1}
$$

Our rule worked, but we restricted it to a particular condition: Where
${n \in \mathbb{Q}.}$ In other words, the power rule, as we originally
formulated it, was limited to rational number powers. We couldn't use it to
compute the derivatives of something like ${x^{\pi},}$ ${x^{\sqrt{2}}}$ or
${x^{e}.}$ These are all irrational powers. Now that we know how to rewrite
bases in terms of ${e}$ and logarithmic differentiation, we can extend the
power rule to apply to all real numbers.

With what we know now, we have a few ways of computing the derivative of
${f(x) = x^r,}$ where ${r \in \RR.}$ One way is to rewrite the base in terms
of ${e:}$

$$
	f(x) = x^r = (e^{\ln x})^r = e^{r \ln x}
$$

Using prime notation to express the derivative:

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx} x^r = (e^{r \ln x})'
$$

we see that we can compute the derivative by applying the chain rule:

$$
	(e^{r \ln x})' = e^{r \ln x} (r \ln x)'
$$

Simplifying, the derivative of the exponential is just itself, so no change
there. The derivative of ${r}$ is zero, since ${r}$ is a constant. And the
derivative of ${\ln x}$ is ${1/x,}$ as we know.

$$
	\begin{aligned} (e^{r \ln x})' &= e^{r \ln x} (r \ln x)' \\[1em] &= e^{r \ln x} \dfrac{r}{x} \\[1em] &= \dfrac{x^r r}{x} \\[1em] &= r \cdot x^{r - 1} \end{aligned}
$$

We've now extended the power rule to all real numbers. We could've also
done the same with logarithmic differentiation. First, we denote ${x^r}$
with the variable ${u:}$

$$
	(u = x ^ r)
$$

Taking the natural logarithm of ${u:}$

$$
	\ln u = r \ln x
$$

Then, we differentiate:

$$
	\begin{aligned} (\ln u)' &= (r \ln x) \\[2em] &= \dfrac{r} {x} \end{aligned}
$$

Next, we use the fact that ${\ln u}$ is the same as ${\dfrac{u'}{u}:}$

$$
	\dfrac{u'}{u} = \dfrac{r}{x}
$$

Solving for ${u':}$

$$
	u' = u \dfrac{r} {x}
$$

Then substituting ${u}$ with ${x^r:}$

$$
	\begin{aligned} u' &= x^r \dfrac{r} {x} \\[2em] &= r x^{r - 1} \end{aligned}
$$

This confirms that the power rule extends to all real numbers. It also
demonstrates that logarithmic differentiation and convering to base ${e}$
are essentially the same methods. The biggest differences: With converting
to base ${e,}$ we must deal with exponents, and with logarithmic
differentiation, we often must introduce new symbols.
