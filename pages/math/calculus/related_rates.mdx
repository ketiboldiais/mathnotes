Consider the following problem:

> **problem**. A traffic enforcement camera lies thirty feet straight from
> the road. A vehicle approaches the camera, and the camera's radar bounces
> off the vehicle. The camera reads the vehicle as fifty feet away. The
> camera also reads vehicle as travelling at eighty feet per second. The
> speed limit is ninety feet per second (or sixty-five miles per hour).
> Question: Is the vehicle speeding?

As usual, we begin by drawing a diagram. We know that the camera lies
thirty feet straight from the road, so it forms a right angle. And since
the camera reads the vehicle as fifty feet away, we have a Heronian
triangle,[^heron_note] specifically a ${3:4:5}$ triangle:

[^heron_note]:
    A <i>Heronian triangle</i> is a triangle whose side lengths and area
    are all integers, named after the Greek mathematician Hero of
    Alexandria.

The next step is to <i>name</i> our quantities. We'll use ${t}$ for time,
measured in seconds.

$$
	t \coloneqq time~~(\text{s})
$$

Next, we want to denote some quantities directly on our diagram:

<Fig

		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1656700746/math/speed_trap_related_rates1_kmzkes.svg"
	}
	imwidth={"201"}
	imheight={"116"}
	caption={"Denoting the quantities with variables"}
	width={"40"}
/>

In our diagram above, we made the following definitions:

1. ${x = 40}$ (the ${x}$ distance from the camera)
2. ${D = 50}$ (the ${x}$ distance between the camera and vehicle)
3. ${\text{SL} = 90 \frac{\text{ft}}{\text{s}}}$ (the speed limit)
4. ${\dfrac{dD}{dt} = 80 \frac{\text{ft}}{\text{s}}}$ (the approach speed)

Why did we denote ${x = 40?}$ Because the problem boils down to determining
whether this proposition is true:

$$
	\dfrac{dx}{dt} > (\text{SL} = 95)
$$

We also denoted ${D = 50}$ because the dstiance between the camera and the
vehicle varies. This is all to show that whenever we deal with variable
quantities, we always want to give them variable names. Constants, on the
other hand, come down to personal style. In some problems, we might want to
give constants variable names to avoid numeric distractions. In others, we
might not want to give constants separate names because numeric quantities
can provide intuition.

Now, the first thing to note is that we're moving towards the camera. This
means that the approach speed is actually:

$$
	\dfrac{dD}{dt} = -80 \frac{\text{ft}}{\text{s}}
$$

In other words, the speed is decreasing at
${80 \frac{\text{ft}}{\text{s}}.}$ Returning to our diagram, we want to
express a relationship between the triangle's lengths. Here, we rely on the
pythagorean theorem:

$$
	x^2 + 30^2 = D^2
$$

At this point, we'll want to differentiate. Here, the easiest approach is
to use implicit differentiation. We'll differentiate the entire equation
with respect to time. In doing so, we want to keep mind not to just
substitute ${40}$ into ${x.}$ Why? Because ${x}$ is variable. Performing
the implicit differentiation:

$$
	\begin{aligned} \dfrac{d}{dx} x^2 + \dfrac{d}{dx} 30^2 &= \dfrac{d}{dx} D^2 \\[1em] 2x \dfrac{dx}{dt} + 0 &= 2D \dfrac{dD}{dt} \\[1em] 2x \dfrac{dx}{dt} &= 2D \dfrac{dD}{dt} \end{aligned}
$$

With the derivative in place, now we can substitute ${x}$ for ${40:}$

$$
	\begin{aligned} 2(40) \dfrac{dx}{dt} &= 2(50)(-80) \\[1em] 80 \dfrac{dx}{dt} &= 2(50)(-80) \\[1em] \cancel{80} \dfrac{dx}{dt} &= 2(50)(-1)\cancel{(80)} \\[1em] \dfrac{dx}{dt} &= -100 \end{aligned}
$$

This gives us our answer:

$$
	\left(\left\lvert \dfrac{dx}{dt} \right\rvert = 100 \frac{\text{ft}}{\text{s}}\right) > 90 \frac{\text{ft}}{\text{s}}
$$

So yes, the vehicle was, in fact, speeding. Assuming, of course, that there
were no calibration issues with the camera and all the necessary elements
of the traffic offense are met.

Let's consider another problem:

> **problem**. A conical tank with a top radius of four feet and a depth of
> ten feet is being filled with water at a rate of two cubic feet per
> minute. How fast is the water rising when the water reaches a depth of
> five feet?

Once again, we begin by diagramming:

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1656700904/math/conic_tank_related_rates_oelpnd.svg"
	}
	imwidth={"221"}
	imheight={"145"}
	caption={"Conic tank"}
	width={"30"}
/>

Looking at our diagram, we see that the cross-section depicting the water
presents similar triangles. Thus:

$$
	\dfrac{r}{h} = \dfrac{4}{10}
$$

Next, we know from geometry that the volume of a cone is given by the
formula:

$$
	V = \dfrac{1}{3}(\pi r^2)h
$$

Next, we're told that the tank is being filled at a rate of two cubic feet
per minute, so we have:

$$
	\dfrac{dV}{dt} = 2 ~\frac{\text{ft}^3}{\text{min}}
$$

Finally, we want to formulate our question:

> What is ${\dfrac{dh}{dt}}$ when ${h = 5?}$

From our ratio ${r/h = 4/10,}$ we can easily express ${r}$ as a function of
${h:}$

$$
	r = \dfrac{2}{5}h
$$

Substitute the expression into ${V:}$

$$
	\begin{aligned} V &= \dfrac{1}{3} \pi \left(\dfrac{2}{5}h\right)^2 h \end{aligned}
$$

At this point, we want to just implicitly differentiate. We don't want to
try and solve for ${h,}$ because just looking at that equation, we can tell
that we'll end up with a cubic root, and that can easily turn nasty.

$$
	\begin{aligned} \dfrac{d}{dt} V &= \dfrac{d}{dt} \dfrac{1}{3} \pi \left(\dfrac{2}{5}h\right)^2 h \\[1em] \dfrac{dV}{dt} &= \dfrac{\pi}{3} \left( \dfrac{2}{5} \right)^2 \dfrac{d}{dt} h^3 \\[1em] \dfrac{dV}{dt} &= \dfrac{\pi}{3} \left( \dfrac{2}{5} \right)^2 3h^2 \dfrac{dh}{dt} \end{aligned}
$$

Now we can plug in the numbers:

$$
	\begin{aligned} 2 &= \dfrac{\pi}{3} \left( \dfrac{2}{5} \right)^2 (3)(5)^2 \dfrac{dh}{dt} \\[1em] 2 &= \dfrac{\pi}{3} \dfrac{2}{5} \dfrac{2}{5} (3)(5)(5) \dfrac{dh}{dt} \\[1em] \cancel{2} &= \dfrac{\pi}{\cancel{3}} \dfrac{\cancel{2}}{\cancel{5}} \dfrac{2}{\cancel{5}} (\cancel{3})(\cancel{5})(\cancel{5}) \dfrac{dh}{dt} \\[1em] 1 &= 2 \pi \dfrac{dh}{dt} \\[1em] \dfrac{1}{2 \pi} &= \dfrac{dh}{dt} \end{aligned}
$$

So, when ${h = 5,}$ we have:

$$
	\dfrac{dh}{dt} = \dfrac{1}{2\pi} ~\frac{\text{ft}}{\text{min}}
$$
