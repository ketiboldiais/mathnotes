# Definite Integrals

Definite integrals are best introduced by first presenting the problem they
are intended to solve: Finding the area under a curve. Consider the diagram
below.

Here, we're visualizing the graph of some function ${y = f(x).}$ Along the
graph are some points ${x = a}$ and ${x = b.}$ The area under the curve is
shaded pink, and is denoted:

$$
	\int_a^b f(x) ~dx
$$

The entire expression above is called a **definite integral**. The function
${f(x)}$ is called the **integrand**, the points ${a}$ and ${b}$ are called
the **limits** or **bounds** of the integral, and the ${dx,}$ a
differential, indicates that the variable of integration is ${x.}$ Given
the bounds ${a}$ and ${b,}$ we say that the integral is over the interval
${[a, b].}$ The interval ${[a,b]}$ is called the **interval of
integration**.

To compute the area, we use the following algorithm:

1. Divide the area into rectangles.
2. Add the areas of the rectangles.
3. Take the limit as the rectangles get infinitely thin.

For example, suppose we had the following curve:

<Fig

	}
	imwidth={"302"}
	imheight={"249"}
	caption={"Initial curve"}
	width={"30"}
/>

To find the area beneath the curve over the interval ${[a,b],}$ we start by
dividing it into rectangles:

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1657552931/math/rectify_2_tm3aim.svg"
	}
	imwidth={"306"}
	imheight={"249"}
	caption={"Dividing into rectangles"}
	width={"30"}
/>

Notice that some of the rectangles go beyond the curve. If we summate the
area for each of these rectangles as is, the area under the curve would be
over the actual area. This is where taking the limit comes in. If we make
the rectangles thinner, we reduce any over and under estimation:

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1657552967/math/rectify_3_hcyucu.svg"
	}
	imwidth={"306"}
	imheight={"249"}
	caption={"Dividing into thinner rectangles"}
	width={"30"}
/>

At some point, the rectangles are so infinitesimally thin that any excess
area is neglibile. With this idea in mind, let's consider an example. Say
we had the function:

$$
	f(x) = x^2
$$

We'll start at ${a = 0}$ and let ${b}$ be arbitrary. Visualizing the area
beneath the curve as consisting of rectangles:

<Fig

	}
	imwidth={"259"}
	imheight={"215"}
	caption={"Notice the rectangles"}
	width={"50"}
/>

Suppose there are ${n}$ rectangles. We know that the area of rectangle is
given by the formula:

$$
	A_r = b \cdot h
$$

If there are ${n}$ rectangles, then the base length is given by:

$$
	\dfrac{b}{n}
$$

Because the base has a length ${b/n,}$ we can determine the height by
passing ${b/n}$ into the function:

| ${x}$             | ${f(x)}$                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ${\dfrac{b}{n}}$  | ${ \left( \dfrac{b}{n} \right)^2 }$  |
| ${\dfrac{2b}{n}}$ | ${ \left( \dfrac{2b}{n} \right)^2 }$ |
| ${\dfrac{3b}{n}}$ | ${ \left( \dfrac{3b}{n} \right)^2 }$ |
| ${\vdots}$        | ${\vdots}$                           |

The sum of the areas is thus:

$$
	\left( \dfrac{b}{n} \right) \left( \dfrac{b}{n} \right)^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{n} \right) \left( \dfrac{2b}{n} \right)^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{n} \right) \left( \dfrac{3b}{n} \right)^2 + \ldots + \left( \dfrac{b}{n} \right) \left( \dfrac{nb}{n} \right)^2
$$

Notice the pattern of the terms. The coefficients go ${1,}$ ${2,}$ ${3,}$
and so on, up to ${n.}$ The formula reduces to:

$$
	\left( \dfrac{b}{n} \right)^3 \left( 1 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + n^2 \right)
$$

Just to ensure the pattern is clear, we'll write ${1}$ as ${1^2:}$

$$
	\left( \dfrac{b}{n} \right)^3 \left( 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + n^2 \right)
$$

Question: How big is this quantity:

$$
	1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + n^2
$$

Since we're working with rectangles, a good starting point is to try and
build a pyramid with a base of ${n \times n.}$

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1657553074/math/pyramid_riemann_sum_q4db4a.svg"
	}
	imwidth={"530"}
	imheight={"248"}
	caption={"Initial pyramid"}
	width={"50"}
/>

In the diagram above, we have two views of the pyramid, a top view and a profile
view. In the profile view, the slope of the dashed red line is ${2.}$ It follows
that the next layer is ${(n-1) \times (n-1).}$ This means the total number of
blocks at the base is ${n^2,}$ the rightmost term in our long expression:

$$
	1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + \textcolor{salmon}{n^2}
$$

If we examine the term a little closer, we see that the term before
${n^2}$ is ${(n-1)^2:}$

$$
	1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + \textcolor{salmon}{(n-1)^2} + n^2
$$

Corresponding to the total number of blocks for the next layer,
${(n-1)^2.}$ The volume of a pyramid with a base of side lengths ${n}$ and
a height of ${n}$ is given by the formula:

$$
	V_p = \dfrac{1}{3}n^2 \cdot n = \dfrac{1}{3} n^3
$$

This tells us the following fact:

$$
	\textcolor{salmon}{\dfrac{1}{3}n^3} < 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + (n-1)^2 + n^2
$$

This new fact (in red) corresponds to the inner pyrmaid, and in turn
corresponds to a lower bound. We can also capture the outer upper bound
(the volume of the pyramid denoted by the green dashed line in the diagram)
with the formula:

$$
	\dfrac{1}{3}(n+1)^2(n+1)
$$

Thus, we have:

$$
	\textcolor{salmon}{\dfrac{1}{3}n^3} < 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + (n-1)^2 + n^2 < \textcolor{green}{\dfrac{1}{3}(n+1)^3}
$$

At this point, we're ready to take the limit. The original expression:

$$
	\left( \dfrac{b}{n} \right)^3 \left( 1 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + n^2 \right)
$$

We want to rewrite this expression as:

$$
	b^3 \left( \dfrac{1^2 + 2^2 + \ldots + n^2}{n^3} \right)
$$

Going back to our inequality, we divide by ${n^3:}$

$$
	\dfrac{\textcolor{salmon}{\dfrac{1}{3}n^3}}{n^3} < \dfrac{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + (n-1)^2 + n^2}{n^3} < \dfrac{\textcolor{green}{\dfrac{1}{3}(n+1)^3}}{n^3}
$$

Reducing, we get:

$$
	\dfrac{1}{3} < \dfrac{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + n^2}{n^3} < \dfrac{1}{3} \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^3
$$

As ${n}$ goes to infinity, we see that:

$$
	\dfrac{1}{3} < \dfrac{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + n^2}{n^3} < \dfrac{1}{3} \left( 1 + \cancel{\dfrac{1}{n}}^{n \to \infty \implies 0} \right)^3
$$

Hence:

$$
	\dfrac{1}{3} < \dfrac{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + n^2}{n^3} < \dfrac{1}{3}
$$

It follows that the total area under ${x^2}$ is:

$$
	\int_0^b x^2~dx = \dfrac{1}{3}b^3
$$

## Summation Notation

With our first example done, we introduce another new bit of notation.
Writing:

$$
	1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n
$$

is tedious. Accordingly, mathematicians use **summation notation** to
express the idea of summing the terms in a sequence of numbers:

$$
	\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} a_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n
$$

Thus, the inequality:

$$
	\dfrac{1}{3} < \dfrac{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + n^2}{n^3} < \dfrac{1}{3} \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^3
$$

can be more concisely written as:

$$
	\dfrac{1}{3} < \dfrac{1}{n^3} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} i^2 < \dfrac{1}{3} \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^3
$$

What we showed, then, was that:

$$
	\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \dfrac{1}{n^3} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} i^2 = \dfrac{1}{3}
$$

Similarly, we can write the expression:

$$
	\left( \dfrac{b}{n} \right) \left( \dfrac{b}{n} \right)^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{n} \right) \left( \dfrac{2b}{n} \right)^2 + \ldots + \left( \dfrac{b}{n} \right) \left( \dfrac{nb}{n} \right)^2
$$

as:

$$
	\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \dfrac{b}{n} \left( \dfrac{ib}{n} \right)^2
$$

This yields the expression:

$$
	\begin{aligned} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \dfrac{b}{n} \left( \dfrac{ib}{n} \right)^2 = \dfrac{b^3}{n^3} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} i^2 \end{aligned}
$$

Let's consider another example: ${f(x) = x.}$ This function is fairly
straightforward in terms of a graph:

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1657553165/math/f_equals_x_oqe0de.svg"
	}
	imwidth={"259"}
	imheight={"216"}
	caption={"Integral of a simple function"}
	width={"50"}
/>

From the graph above, we see that the area beneath the curve is a triangle,
with sides of length ${b.}$ The area is thus:

$$
	A = \dfrac{1}{2} b \cdot h = \dfrac{1}{2}b^2
$$

Notice that we didn't have to do any of the complex calculations we saw
previously. There is, however, an even simpler example: ${f(x) = 1.}$

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1657553206/math/f_equals_1_xebbrl.svg"
	}
	imwidth={"259"}
	imheight={"215"}
	caption={"Integral of another simple function"}
	width={"50"}
/>

The area is simply:

$$
	A = b \cdot h = b \cdot 1 = b
$$

With these simpler examples, we now have enough to see a pattern:

| ${f(x)}$ | ${\int_0^b f(x)~dx}$ |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| ${x^2}$  | ${\dfrac{b^3}{3}}$   |
| ${x}$    | ${\dfrac{b^2}{2}}$   |
| ${1}$    | ${b}$                |

Perhaps the pattern isn't so obvious. Let's rewrite the functions with
powers:

| ${f(x)}$ | ${\int_0^b f(x)~dx}$ |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| ${x^2}$  | ${\dfrac{b^3}{3}}$   |
| ${x^1}$  | ${\dfrac{b^2}{2}}$   |
| ${x^0}$  | ${\dfrac{b^1}{1}}$   |

Examining this pattern, we might reasonably guess that:

$$
	\int_0^b x^3~dx = \dfrac{b^4}{4}
$$

In a later section, we'll see that this guess is correct.

## Summation and Integration

To put things in perspective, let's take a step back and look at the
relationship between summation and integration from a high-level view. First,
integration, in the crudest terms, is just "fancy addition." We're trying to
find a sum, but instead of having all of the terms in front of us, we're given a
formula for where those terms live. We call it "fancy addition" because we're
doing a bit more work to get the sum. In fact, to reinforce this idea even
further, the integral symbol:

$$
	\Large \int
$$

is actually called a _medial s_ (or _long s_), and it was how Medieval writers
in continental Europe wrote the letter 's'. The 's', as we might have guessed by
now, stands for "summa," the Latin word for "sum." Who chose this symbol? None
other than the notation wizard himself — Gottfried Leibniz.

Once we view integration this way, we realize that summation and
integration are simply two sides of the same coin:

<Grid cols={2}>

$$
	\Large \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \Delta x
$$

$$
	\Large \int_{a}^{b} f(x) ~dx
$$

</Grid>

Summation reveals the discrete side, and integration the continous.
