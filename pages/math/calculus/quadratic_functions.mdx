# Quadratic Functions

Quadratic functions are polynomial functions of the form:

$$
	f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
$$

All quadratic functions form a U-shaped graph called a **parabola**.
Accordingly, quadratic functions may also be called **parabolic
functions**. Arguably, the most familiar quadratic function is the squaring
function, ${f(x) = x^2.}$ This function has the graph:

<Plot functions={[{ f: (x) => x ** 2, color: "var(--red)" }]} scale={60} />

The function ${f(x) = x^2}$ itself is a quadratic function in standard
form, where ${a = 1,}$ ${b = 0,}$ and ${c = 0.}$

## Quadratic Functions vs. Quadratic Equations

Given that quadratic functions are functions of the form
${f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c,}$ quadratic functions are defined in terms of
quadratic equations. However, not all quadratic equations have parabolas
for graphs. Recall that a quadratic equation is an equation of the form:

$$
	Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0
$$

Depending on the choice of ${A,}$ ${B,}$ ${C,}$ ${D,}$ ${E,}$ and ${F,}$
the quadratic equation might form a parabola, a circle, an ellipse, or a
hyperbola. How do we know which one we have? Through the **discriminant**,
${B^2 - 4AC.}$ In general:

1. If ${B^2 - 4AC < 0,}$ then the quadratic equation graphs an ellipse.
2. If ${B^2 - 4AC = 0,}$ then the quadratic equation graphs a parabola.
3. If ${B^2 - 4AC > 0,}$ then the quadratic equation graphs a hyperbola.
