In this section, we examine the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC)**.
Understanding this theorem is critical to understanding integration — it's
the bridge between differential calculus and integral calculus. The first
published statement and proof of the theorem traces to the British
mathematician James Gregory in the 1600s. Another mathematician of the same
era, Isaac Barrow, proved a more generalized form of the theorem. Barrow's
student, Isaac Newton, presented a final, complete proof sometime in 1670.
Importantly, these proofs were presented as geometric theorems, but later
couched in calculus terms by other mathematicians.

In crude terms, FTC provides that the derivative of an integral will give
us the function that results in that integral. Less crudely:

> **fundamental theorem of calculus**. If ${f(x)}$ is continuous over an
> interval ${[a,b],}$ then:
>
> $$
> 	F'(x) = f(x) \iff \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
> $$

That is, if the function ${F'(x)}$ equals ${f(x),}$ then the integral from
${a}$ to ${b}$ of ${f(x) dx}$ is equal to ${F(b) - F(a).}$

Let's unpack this slowly. First, ${F}$ is the antiderivative of ${f.}$
Thus, if we can compute the integral of ${f(x) dx}$ from ${a}$ to ${b}$
with the following steps:

1. Find the antiderivative of ${f.}$
2. Call that function ${F.}$
3. Plug in the upper bound ${b}$ to ${F:}$ ${F(b).}$
4. Plug in the lower bound ${a}$ to ${F:}$ ${F(a).}$
5. Return ${F(b) - F(a)}$

then we can conclude that the derivative of ${F}$, ${F'}$, is in fact
${f.}$ There's a reason why the theorem is given the descriptor
fundamental. It effectively establishes:

1. There's a relationship between integration and differentiation.
2. Any integrable function will have an antiderivative.
3. Any continuous function will have an antiderivative.

Note that FTC can be expressed in alternative notation. The expression
${F(b) - F(a)}$ can also be written as:

$$
	F(b) - F(a) = \left. F(x) \right\vert_{a}^{b}
$$

Because of this fact, FTC's proposition can also be expressed as:

$$
	F'(x) = f(x) \implies \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = \left. F(x) \right\vert_{a}^{b}
$$

This notation is particularly useful when we must handle multiple
variables:

$$
	F'(x) = f(x) \implies \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = \left. F(x) \right\vert_{x = a}^{x = b}
$$

$$
	F(x) = \int f(x) dx
$$

Let's consider some examples. Suppose:

$$
	F(x) = \dfrac{x^3}{3}
$$

If we differentiate, we get:

$$
	F'(x) = x^2
$$

Applying FTC, we have:

$$
	\int_{a}^{b} x^2 dx = F(b) - F(a) = \dfrac{b^3}{3} - \dfrac{a^3}{3}
$$

Suppose ${a = 0.}$ Then:

$$
	\begin{aligned} \int_{0}^{b} x^2 dx = F(b) - F(0) &= \dfrac{b^3}{3} - \dfrac{0^3}{3} \\[1em] &= \dfrac{b^3}{3} \end{aligned}
$$

## The Average Change of an Antiderivative

Let's look at FTC another way:

$$
	F(b) - F(a) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx
$$

All we've done here is reverse the formula. Now, recall the relationship
between ${F'}$ and FTC:

$$
	F'(x) = f(x) \implies \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

Keeping this in mind, let's rewrite our reversed formula using the
following notation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	&\Delta F = F(b) - F(a) \\
	&\Delta x = b - a
\end{aligned}
$$

This yields:

> $$
> 	\Delta F = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx
> $$

It turns out that this is the standard way of expressing FTC notationally.
Say we divide the lefthand side by ${\Delta x.}$ We get:

$$
	\dfrac{\Delta F}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx
$$

The righthand side is a fairly important expression:

> **average change of an antiderivative**. Let ${f}$ be a differentiable
> function. Then the average change of ${F}$ (the antiderivative of ${f}$),
> denoted ${\mm{Avg}(F),}$ is:
>
> $$
> 	\mm{Avg}(F) = \dfrac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx
> $$

Just to be clear, the average of value of a function is the sum of the
values of the function given an input ${x_0}$ to an input ${x_n,}$ divided
by the number of inputs ${n.}$ That is:

$$
	\dfrac{f(x_0) + f(x_1) + \ldots + f(x_n)}{n}
$$

This is a special type of Riemann sum:

$$
	\dfrac{f(x_0) + f(x_1) + \ldots + f(x_n)}{n} = \dfrac{1}{n} \int_{0}^{n} f(x) dx : \Delta x = 1
$$

That is, the integral from ${0}$ to ${n}$ where the increment is 1. If the
increment were instead ${\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0},}$ we would get the
_continuous average_ of ${f.}$ With ${\Delta x = 1,}$ we have the _discrete
average_ of ${f.}$

The lemma we stated above tells us that the average change of the
antiderivative of ${f}$ on ${a}$ to ${b}$ can be found by computing:

$$
	\dfrac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx
$$

Using this fact, we can rewrite FTC formula again:

$$
	\Delta F = \mm{Avg}(F') \Delta x
$$

That is, the change in ${F}$ is the average infinitesimal change, times the
total amount of change.

## The Mean Value Theorem and The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Recall that the _mean value theorem_ says:

$$
	f'(c) = \dfrac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}
$$

Because ${F}$ is a function, the mean value theorem also applies:

$$
	F'(c) = \dfrac{F(b) - F(a)}{b-a}
$$

Rewriting without substitute notation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	F'(c) &= \dfrac{\Delta F}{\Delta x} \\[1em]
	\Delta F &= F'(c) \Delta x
\end{aligned}
$$

Comparing the two formulas, FTC formula is much more specific than the MVT.
With MVT, the value ${c}$ likes somewhere between ${a}$ and ${b.}$ That is,

$$
	a < c < b
$$

Accordingly, all we can conclude with the MVT is:

$$
	F_{\mm{min}}' \Delta x~~~\leq~~~\Delta F = F'(c) \Delta x~~~\leq~~~F_{\mm{max}}' \Delta x
$$

What this tells us is that FTC is a _much_ strong conclusion that the MVT.
It's obvious that the average is less than or equal to the maximum ${F'}$.
And it's also obvious that the average is greater than or equal to the
minimum ${F'.}$ Thus, we can draw the same conclusion that we would with
the MVT:

$$
	F_{\mm{min}}' \Delta x~~~\leq~~~\Delta F = \mm{Avg}(F') \Delta x~~~\leq~~~F_{\mm{max}}' \Delta x
$$

The difference, however, is that ${\Delta F}$ is a very specific value:

$$
	\dfrac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx
$$

That's far more specific and affirmative compared to what the MVT gives us:
"Oh, it's ${F'(c)}$ times ${\Delta x}$ where ${c}$ is between ${b}$ and
${a.}$ What ${c}$ is, I couldn't tell you."

To illustrate, suppose we were given the following problem:

> **problem.** Given the facts:
>
> 1.  ${F(x) = \dfrac{1}{1+x}}$
> 2.  ${F(0) = 1}$
>
> For what values of ${a}$ and ${b}$ is the following proposition true:
>
> $$
>     	a < F(4) < b
> $$

Using just the MVT, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	F(4) - F(0) &= F'(c) \cdot (4-0) \\
	&= \dfrac{1}{1+c} \cdot 4
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the range of possible values is ${4}$ to ${\dfrac{4}{5}.}$ It follows
that:

$$
	\dfrac{4}{5} < F(4) - F(0) < 4
$$

And since ${F(0) = 1,}$ we have:

$$
	\dfrac{9}{5} < F(4) < 5
$$

Now let's compare that to using FTC. With FTC, we have:

$$
	F(4) - F(0) = \int_{0}^{4} \dfrac{dx}{1+x}
$$

The largest possible value of ${F(4)-F(0)}$ is when ${x=0:}$

$$
	F(4) - F(0) \leq \int_{0}^{4} dx
$$

Since ${\int_{0}^{4} dx}$ is just the integral of ${1}$ from ${0}$ to
${4}$, we have:

$$
	F(4) - F(0) \leq 4
$$

The smallest possible value of ${F(4)-F(0)}$ is when ${x=4:}$

$$
	F(4) - F(0) \geq \int_{0}^{4} \dfrac{1}{5} dx
$$

We know that ${\int_{0}^{4} dx = 4,}$ so we can deduce that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	F(4) - F(0) &\geq \dfrac{1}{5} \int_{0}^{4} dx \\[1em]
	&\geq \dfrac{1}{5} \int_{0}^{4} dx \\[1em]
	&\geq \dfrac{1}{5} (4) \\[1em]
	&\geq \dfrac{4}{5}
\end{aligned}
$$

So, we conclude that:

$$
	\dfrac{4}{5} \leq F(4) - F(0) \leq 4
$$

And, once again, using the fact that ${F(0) = 1,}$ we have:

$$
	\dfrac{9}{5} \leq F(4) \leq 5
$$

Finally, because the integral is a summation of infinitesimals, we know
that the inequalities are actually strict:

$$
	\dfrac{9}{5} < F(4) < 5
$$

## Restatement of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Here is another statement of FTC:

> **restatement of the fundamental theorem of calculus**
>
> Iff:
>
> 1.  ${f}$ is a continuous function.
> 2.  ${G(x) = \int_{a}^{x} f(t)~dt.}$
> 3.  ${a \leq t \leq x.}$
>
> then:
>
> $$
> 	G'(x) = f(x)
> $$
>
> Or, alternatively:
>
> $$
> 	\dfrac{d}{dx} \int_{a}^{x} f(t)~dt = f(x)
> $$

Let's be very clear about this proposition's components. First, the
integrand's bounds are from ${a}$ to ${x.}$ ${a}$ is the lower bound, and
${x}$ is the upper bound. Thus, the area we're interested lies somewhere
between, or is the entire area, beneath ${F(x) - F(a).}$

Second, we're using a dummy variable ${t.}$ The value of this variable lies
anywhere between fixed values of ${a}$ and ${x.}$ Because it lies between
these points, it's called the _variable of integration_. Do not, under any
circumstances, mix ${x}$ and ${t.}$ This is a very common practice in older
calculus textbooks, but it is extremely careless and dangerous.

The statement above is just an alternative statement of FTC. Why? Because
if we're given an ${a,}$ and we're given an ${x,}$ we get the exact same
statement we saw earlier. To see why this restatement is useful, let's just
stare at the restatement's conclusion for a moment:

$$
	G'(x) = f(x)
$$

On its own, ${G'(x)}$ is a solution to the differential equation:

$$
	y' = f,~\mm{where}~ y(a) = 0
$$

That is, ${G'(x)}$ is a solution to the differential equation ${y' = f,}$
where the initial condition is ${y(a) = 0.}$ The restatement tells us that
we can always — _always_ — solve the differential equation above. This is a
foundational premise for the field of differential equations.

For example, consider this problem:

> **problem**. Evaluate:
>
> $$
> 	\dfrac{d}{dx} \int_{1}^{x} \dfrac{dt}{t^2}
> $$

On its face, it doesn't look like what we've discussed so far allows us to
solve this. But, remember the restatement. The term:

$$
	\int_{1}^{x} \dfrac{dt}{t^2}
$$

is just ${G(x).}$ Thus:

$$
	G(x) = \int_{1}^{x} \dfrac{dt}{t^2}
$$

And we know that:

$$
	G'(x) = f(x)
$$

What's ${f(x)?}$ It's the integrand:

$$
	\int_{1}^{x} f(t)~dt,~~~f(t) = \dfrac{1}{t^2}
$$

Thus, we have:

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx} \int_{1}^{x} \dfrac{dt}{t^2} = \dfrac{1}{x^2}
$$

Just to make sure we've done this correctly, let's actually integrate:

$$
	\int_{1}^{x} \dfrac{1}{t^2}~dt
$$

Integrating, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\int_{t=1}^{t=x} \dfrac{1}{t^2}~dt &= \left. -\dfrac{1}{t} \right\vert_{t=1}^{t=x} \\[1em]

	&= -\dfrac{1}{x} - (-1) \\[1em]
	&= -\dfrac{1}{x} + 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, we know that:

$$
	G(x) = \dfrac{d}{dx} \paren{1 - \dfrac{1}{x}}
$$

If we differentiate ${G,}$ we get:

$$
	G'(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2}
$$

## FTC Proof 1

Here is the first proof of FTC we'll present. Suppose we have the following
graph:

<Plot
	data={[{ f: (x) => Math.sqrt(x) }]}
	domain={[0, 8]}
	range={[0, 4]}
	scale={50}
	ticks={0}
/>

Now say the area we're interested in is from ${a}$ to ${x,}$ as presented
below:

<Plot
	data={[
		{ f: (x) => Math.sqrt(x), integrate: [1, 4, "x"] },
		{
			f: 4,
			dash: 2,
			color: "grey",
			integrate: [4, 5, (x) => Math.sqrt(x)],
			integrationColor: "var(--gold)",
		},
		{ f: 5, dash: 2, color: "grey" },
		{ t: "a", x: 1, y: 0 },
		{ t: "x", x: 4, y: 0 },
		{ t: "\\Delta G", x: 4.3, y: 1, fontsize: 1 },
		{ t: "G(x)", x: 2, y: 1, fontsize: 1 },
		{ t: "x+\\Delta x", x: 5, y: 0 },
	]}
	domain={[0, 8]}
	range={[0, 4]}
	scale={60}
	ticks={0}
/>

Viewing the area ${\Delta G}$ as if it were a rectangle, we know that the
base is ${\Delta x.}$ So, we now want to find its height. Well, the height
is either ${f(x),}$ or ${f(x+\Delta x).}$ Ultimately, it doesn't matter. We
know that ${f}$ is continuous (by assumption):

$$
	\lim\limits_{\Delta \to x} \dfrac{\Delta G}{\Delta x} = f(x)
$$

## FTC Proof 2

Now let's examine the second proof. First, we start with the hypothesis:

> **hypothesis**. ${F' = f.}$

Next, we will assume that ${f}$ is continuous.[^note_continuous] Next, we
will say that the following definition applies:

> **definition**. ${G(x) = \int_{a}^{x} f(t)~dt}$

Now we apply our conclusion from the previous proof. There, we concluded
that:

$$
	G'(x) = f(x)
$$

We also know that ${F'(x) = f(x)}$ (the derivative of the antiderivative of
${f}$ is ${f}$). Hence, it follows that:

$$
	F'(x) = G'(x)
$$

And by the mean value theorem, we know that if two functions have the same
derivative, they differ by a constant. Or, if a function has the derivative
zero, the function is a constant. And since ${F(x)}$ and ${G(x)}$ have the
same derivative, namely ${f,}$ it follows that:

$$
	F(x) = G(x) + C
$$

where ${C}$ is some constant. All that's left to do is arithmetic:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		F(b) - F(a) &= (G(b)+C) - (G(a)+C) \\
		&= G(b) - G(a) \\
	\end{aligned}
$$

We know that this integral runs from ${a}$ to ${b}$. Thus, the term
${G(a)}$ is zero, since it returns the integral from ${a}$ to ${a:}$

$$
	F(b) - F(a) = G(b) - 0
$$

And ${G(b)}$ is just the integral of ${f}$ from ${a}$ to ${b:}$

$$
	F(b) - F(a) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x)~dx
$$

[^note_continuous]:
    As an aside, this is a significant assumption to make, and it's
    something that must be proved in its own right. The materials on real
    analysis focus extensively on proving this foundational premise.

## FTC and Transcendentals

If the previous sections weren't enough to warrant FTC's namesake, perhaps
the next sections will. It turns out that FTC opens an entirely new world
of numbers and functions: _transcendentals_. These are numbers and
functions outside the world of classical algebra. That is, nothing we've
learned before FTC allows us to understand or work with objects in this
realm. To better understand what this means, we begin by considering what
FTC can tell us about functions we've already seen.

### FTC Interpretation of Logarithmic Functions

The FTC provides an alternative way of defining and interpreting
logarithmic functions. To begin, suppose we have the following derivative:

$$
	y' = \dfrac{1}{x}
$$

By FTC, we can say that the logarithm is defined as:

$$
	L(x) = \int_{1}^{x} \dfrac{1}{t} ~dt
$$

We know that:

$$
	L'(x) = \dfrac{1}{x}
$$

If we evaluate the function ${L}$ at ${x=1,}$ we have:

$$
	L(1) = \int_{1}^{1} \dfrac{1}{t}~dt = 0
$$

Next, let's compute the second derivative of ${L:}$

$$
	L''(x) = -\dfrac{1}{x^2}
$$

Accordingly, where ${y' = \dfrac{1}{x},}$ we have the following conclusions
and subconclusions:

1. ${L'(x) = \dfrac{1}{x}}$
   - At ${x=1,}$ ${L'(x) = 1.}$
2. ${L''(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2}}$
   - ${L''}$ is _concave down_ at every place.
3. ${L(1) = 0}$

With these premises, we can sketch a graph:

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1657646717/math/log_integral_graph_nltl6b.svg"
	}
	imwidth={"282"}
	imheight={"308"}
	caption={"Sketching with the premises"}
	width={"50"}
/>

The actual graph:

<Plot
	data={[
		{ f: (x) => Math.log(x) },
		{ f: (x) => x - 1, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ f: Math.E, dash: 2, color: "lightgrey" },
		{ f: (x) => 1, dash: 2, color: "lightgrey" },
		{ t: "y=1", x: 0.5, y: 1.3 },
		{ t: "x=e", x: 2.8, y: -0.5 },
	]}
	domain={[-1, 5]}
	range={[-1, 5]}
	scale={60}
/>

Notice that from the sketch, we see see that when ${x < 1,}$ we have
${x \leq 1.}$ This behavior is expected. ${L(1) = 0,}$ and ${L}$ is
increasing. This means that before 0, ${L}$ must be negative.

So, we see that FTC presents another way to define — and as a side-effect,
sketch — the logarithmic function. Is there anything else? Sure. The FTC
gives us another way to prove that:

$$
	L(ab) = L(a) + L(b)
$$

where ${L}$ is a logarithmic function. The first step we can take is to
just plug-and-play. To do so, we break the integral down into two parts:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		L(ab) &= L(a) + L(b) \\
		&= \int_{1}^{ab} \dfrac{dt}{t} \\
		&= \int_{1}^{a} \dfrac{dt}{t} + \int_{a}^{ab} \dfrac{dt}{t}
	\end{aligned}
$$

Now we're going to perform a little trick. We're going to say that:

$$
	t = au
$$

Using this variable, we can say that:

$$
	dt = adu
$$

And if we can say that, we can write:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\int_{a}^{ab} \dfrac{dt}{t} &= \int \dfrac{adu}{au} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we have to set the limits. First, we know that when ${t = a,}$ that's
the lower limit. In that case, we have:

$$
	u = 1
$$

Knowing this lower limit, we can add the lower bound to our rewritten
integral:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\int_{t=a}^{ab} \dfrac{dt}{t} &= \int_{u=1} \dfrac{adu}{au} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Likewise, when ${t = ab,}$ we know that ${u = b.}$ That gives us the upper
bound:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\int_{t=a}^{t=ab} \dfrac{dt}{t} &= \int_{u=1}^{u=b} \dfrac{adu}{au} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Cancelling out the ${a}$ in our rewritten integral, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\int_{t=a}^{t=ab} \dfrac{dt}{t} &= \int_{u=1}^{u=b} \dfrac{du}{u} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

which is precisely what we wanted to find.

### A New Function

Here's a function we haven't seen before:

$$
	F(x) = \int_{0}^{x} e^{-t^2}~dt
$$

FTC gives us the derivative:

$$
	F'(x) = e^{-x^2}
$$

We also know that ${F(0) = 0.}$ Further, ${F'(0) = 1,}$ which tells us that
the tangent line has a slope of 1. If we then examine the second
derivative:

$$
	F''(x) = -2xe^{-x^2}
$$

Comparing the two functions:

<Grid cols={2}>

$$
	F'(x) = e^{-x^2}
$$

$$
	F''(x) = -2xe^{-x^2}
$$

</Grid>

Side by side, we see that ${F}$ is an odd function:

$$
	F(-x) = -F(x)
$$

Why? Because ${F}$ is the antiderivative of ${F',}$ and ${F'}$ is an even
function. Next, we can determine that the function ${F'(x) = e^{-x^2}}$ is
increasing. Examining the graph:

<Plot
	data={[{ f: (x) => Math.E ** (-1 * x ** 2) }]}
	domain={[-3.5, 3.5]}
	range={[-3.5, 3.5]}
	scale={70}
/>

The the graph of the slope of ${F'}$ (the graph of ${F''}$):

<Plot
	data={[{ f: (x) => -2 * x * Math.E ** (-1 * x ** 2) }]}
	domain={[-3.5, 3.5]}
	range={[-3.5, 3.5]}
	scale={70}
/>

There's a very special property of the graph of ${F''.}$ It has bounds
above and below:

<Plot
	data={[
		{ f: (x) => -2 * x * Math.E ** (-1 * x ** 2) },
		{ f: (x) => Math.sqrt(Math.PI) / 2, color: "var(--blue)", dash: 3 },
		{ f: (x) => -Math.sqrt(Math.PI) / 2, color: "var(--blue)", dash: 3 },
	]}
	domain={[-3.5, 3.5]}
	range={[-3.5, 3.5]}
	scale={70}
/>

Even more interestingly, the values of the top and bottom bounds equal the
infinite left and right areas beneath the graph of ${F'}$ respectively:

<Plot
	data={[
		{
			f: (x) => Math.E ** (-1 * x ** 2),
			integrate: [0, 3, "x"],
			integrationColor: "var(--blue)",
		},
		{
			f: (x) => Math.E ** (-1 * x ** 2),
			integrate: [-3, 0, "x"],
			integrationColor: "var(--gold)",
		},
	]}
	domain={[-3.5, 3.5]}
	range={[-3.5, 3.5]}
	scale={70}
/>

What is this number? It's ${\dfrac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}:}$

<Plot
	data={[
		{ f: (x) => -2 * x * Math.E ** (-1 * x ** 2) },
		{ f: (x) => Math.sqrt(Math.PI) / 2, color: "var(--blue)", dash: 3 },
		{ f: (x) => -Math.sqrt(Math.PI) / 2, color: "var(--blue)", dash: 3 },
		{ t: "y = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}", x: 1, y: 1.4 },
		{ t: "y = -\\dfrac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}", x: 1, y: -1 },
	]}
	domain={[-3.5, 3.5]}
	range={[-3.5, 3.5]}

This is a very special quantity, accompanied by a fascinating result:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\lim\limits_{x \to +\infty} e^{-x^2} &= \dfrac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \\[1em]
	\lim\limits_{x \to -\infty} e^{-x^2} &= -\dfrac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

This conclusion is encapsulated through the **error function**.

### Fresnel Integral

Another set of functions that we cannot integrate without using FTC are the
Fresnel functions:

$$
	\text{C}(x) = \int_{0}^{x} \cos (t^2) dt \\[1em]
	\text{S}(x) = \int_{0}^{x} \sin (t^2) dt \\[1em]
	\text{H}(x) = \int_{0}^{x} \dfrac{\sin t}{t} dt
$$

### Logarithmic Integral

The _logarithmic integral function_ is yet another non-elementary function:

$$
	\text{Li}(x) = \int_{2}^{x} \dfrac{dt}{\ln t}
$$

This integral has a peculiar property. If we pass some number ${x}$ as an
input:

$$
	\text{Li}(x) \approx \pi(x)
$$

where ${\pi(x)}$ is the number of primes less than or equal to ${x.}$ How
closely does ${\text{Li}(x)}$ approximate ${\pi(x)}$? Anyone who answers
this question will be famous for millenia: This is an open question in
mathematics called the **Riemann Hypothesis**.
