# Areas Between Curves

Say we have a pair of curves:

<Plot
	data={[
		{ f: (x) => 0.3 * (x - 3) ** 2 + 1 },
		{ f: (x) => -(0.3 * (x - 3) ** 2 - 3) },
		{ f: 2, dash: 3, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ f: 4, dash: 3, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ t: "f(x)", x: 6.3, y: 4 },
		{ t: "g(x)", x: 6.6, y: -0.5 },
	]}
	domain={[-1, 8]}
	range={[-1, 8]}
	scale={60}
	ticks={0}
/>

What's the area betwee ${a}$ and ${b}$? Well, we can chop it up into
Riemann sums:

<Plot
	data={[
		{
			f: (x) => 0.3 * (x - 3) ** 2 + 1,
			riemann: {
				f: (x) => -(0.3 * (x - 3) ** 2 - 3),
				m: "left",
				i: [2, 4],
				dx: 0.7,
			},
		},
		{ f: (x) => -(0.3 * (x - 3) ** 2 - 3) },
		{ f: 2, dash: 3, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ f: 4, dash: 3, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ t: "f(x)", x: 6.3, y: 4 },
		{ t: "g(x)", x: 6.6, y: -0.5 },
		{ t: "a", x: 1.9, y: 0 },
		{ t: "b", x: 3.9, y: 0 },
	]}
	domain={[-1, 8]}
	range={[-1, 8]}
	scale={60}
	ticks={0}
/>

We'll denote the width of each rectangle as ${dx.}$ What's the height? It's
the difference between the top point of the rectangle (where the rectangle
touches ${f(x)}$) and the bottom point of the rectangle (where it touches
${g(x)}$). Thus, for a _single_ rectangle we have the area:

$$
	A_i = (f(x) - g(x)) \cdot dx
$$

Making ${dx}$ smaller:

<Plot
	data={[
		{
			f: (x) => 0.3 * (x - 3) ** 2 + 1,
			riemann: {
				f: (x) => -(0.3 * (x - 3) ** 2 - 3),
				m: "left",
				i: [2, 4],
				dx: 0.3,
			},
		},
		{ f: (x) => -(0.3 * (x - 3) ** 2 - 3) },
		{ f: 2, dash: 3, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ f: 4, dash: 3, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ t: "f(x)", x: 6.3, y: 4 },
		{ t: "g(x)", x: 6.6, y: -0.5 },
		{ t: "a", x: 1.9, y: 0 },
		{ t: "b", x: 3.9, y: 0 },
	]}
	domain={[-1, 8]}
	range={[-1, 8]}
	scale={60}
	ticks={0}
/>

and smaller:

<Plot
	data={[
		{
			f: (x) => 0.3 * (x - 3) ** 2 + 1,
			riemann: {
				f: (x) => -(0.3 * (x - 3) ** 2 - 3),
				m: "left",
				i: [2, 4],
				dx: 0.1,
			},
		},
		{ f: (x) => -(0.3 * (x - 3) ** 2 - 3) },
		{ f: 2, dash: 3, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ f: 4, dash: 3, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ t: "f(x)", x: 6.3, y: 4 },
		{ t: "g(x)", x: 6.6, y: -0.5 },
		{ t: "a", x: 1.9, y: 0 },
		{ t: "b", x: 3.9, y: 0 },
	]}
	domain={[-1, 8]}
	range={[-1, 8]}
	scale={60}
	ticks={0}
/>

and even smaller:

<Plot
	data={[
		{
			f: (x) => 0.3 * (x - 3) ** 2 + 1,
			riemann: {
				f: (x) => -(0.3 * (x - 3) ** 2 - 3),
				m: "left",
				i: [2, 4],
				dx: 0.05,
			},
		},
		{ f: (x) => -(0.3 * (x - 3) ** 2 - 3) },
		{ f: 2, dash: 3, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ f: 4, dash: 3, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ t: "f(x)", x: 6.3, y: 4 },
		{ t: "g(x)", x: 6.6, y: -0.5 },
		{ t: "a", x: 1.9, y: 0 },
		{ t: "b", x: 3.9, y: 0 },
	]}
	domain={[-1, 8]}
	range={[-1, 8]}
	scale={60}
	ticks={0}
/>

we eventually fill in the area bounded to the left by ${a,}$ to the right
by ${b,}$ above by ${f(x),}$ and below by ${g(x).}$ What's the value of
this area? It's the sum of all the areas of the individual rectangles:

$$
	A_T = A_0 + A_1 + A_2 + \ldots + A_n
$$

Now that we've seen integrals, this is really:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	A_T &= A_0 + A_1 + A_2 + \ldots + A_n \\[1em]
	&= \int_{a}^{b} (f(x) - g(x)) dx
\end{aligned}
$$

This is how we find the area between two curves. Importantly, whenever we
want to know such an area we want to first identify the **integrand** (our
rectangle's height):

$$
	\int_{a}^{b} {\color{blue}(f(x) - g(x))} dx
$$

Once we have this information, we want to know the **limits**, or
**bounds**:

$$
	{\color{red}\int_{a}^{b}} (f(x) - g(x)) dx
$$

These are the key pieces of information. We want to know the lower bound
${a,}$ the upper bound ${b,}$ and the integrand ${f(x)-g(x).}$ While it may
seem like a simple task, it turns out that for many areas, this can be
difficult. For example, consider the following problem:

> **problem.** What is the area between ${x = y^2}$ and ${y=x-2?}$

The first step is to always try and create a visualization of the curves.

<Plot
	data={[
		{ x: (y) => y ** 2, y: (x) => x, color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: (x) => x - 2, color: "var(--blue)" },
	]}
	scale={60}
	domain={[-2, 6]}
	range={[-5, 6]}
	ticks={0}
/>

At this point, we see a problem. ${x = y^2}$ is not a function. A function
is a a relation from ${\RR \to \RR.}$ Thus, for ${x = y^2,}$ we've
effectively specified the set of ordered pairs:

$$
	\{ (x,y) \in \RR^2 : x = y^2 \}
$$

And in doing so, it's no longer clear whether ${x}$ is a function of ${y,}$
or whether ${y}$ is a function of ${x.}$ And because of that ambiguity, we
have a situation where it's unclear where our rectangles' heights start and
end. It could start at ${x = y^2}$ and end at ${y = x-2.}$ It could start
at ${x = y^2}$ and end at ${x = y^2:}$

<Plot
	data={[
		{
			f: (x) => Math.sqrt(x),
			riemann: { f: (x) => x - 2, i: [2, 3], dx: 0.09 },
		},
		{
			f: (x) => -Math.sqrt(x),
			riemann: { f: (x) => Math.sqrt(x), i: [0, 0.5], dx: 0.09 },
		},
		{ f: (x) => x - 2, color: "var(--blue)" },
	]}
	scale={60}
	domain={[-2, 6]}
	range={[-5, 6]}
	ticks={0}
/>

To solve this problem, we'll have to split the area into two halves and sum
the two after. And to do that, we need the intersection points:

<Plot
	data={[
		{ x: (y) => y ** 2, y: (x) => x, color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: (x) => x - 2, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{
			f: (x) => Math.sqrt(x),
			domain: [0, 4],
			color: "var(--green)",
			w: 3,
		},
		{
			f: (x) => -Math.sqrt(x),
			domain: [0, 1],
			color: "var(--purple)",
			w: 3,
		},
		{ f: 1, color: "grey", dash: 3 },
		{ p: [0, 0], label: `(0,0)`, dx: 1, dy: 1, r: 5, in: true },
		{ p: [1, -1], label: `(1,-1)`, dx: 1, dy: 1, r: 5, in: true },
		{ p: [4, 2], label: `(4,2)`, dx: 1, dy: 1, r: 5, in: true },
	]}
	scale={60}
	domain={[-2, 6]}
	range={[-5, 6]}
	ticks={0}
/>

Since ${x = y^2}$ and ${y = x-2,}$ we have:

$$
	y = y^2 - 2
$$

This is a quadratic. Solve for ${y:}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
	y^2 - y - 2 &= 0 \\
	(y+2)(y-2) &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, we have:

$$
	y \in \{ 2, -1 \}
$$

Next, from the implicit function theorem, we know that the top curve can be
rewritten as:

$$
		y = \sqrt{x}
$$

and the bottom curve is:

$$
	y = - \sqrt{x}
$$

Finally, the line between the ${(1,-1)}$ and ${(4,2)}$ is given by the
equation:

$$
	y = x - 2
$$

At this point, we can find the area:

$$
	\text{A} = \int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{x} - (-\sqrt{x}) dx + \int_{1}^{4} \sqrt{x} - (x - 2) dx
$$

## Integrating for a Different Variable

The procedure above is meticulous. There's a much faster way: Integrating
with respect to ${y.}$ Visually, this means we compute the area by dividing
the region into _horizontal rectangles_.

To do so, we rewrite all of the equations to render them as _true
functions_. Thus:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		x = y^2 \implies x &= y^2 \\
		y = x - 2 \implies x &= y + 2
	\end{aligned}
$$

Now we integrate in the ${dy}$ variable:

$$
	\int_{-1}^{2} (y+2 - y^2) dy
$$

The ${y+2}$ gives us the left endpoint of the rectangle, and the ${y^2}$
gives us the right endpoint of the rectangle.
