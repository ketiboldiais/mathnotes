## Speaking Mathematics
### Expressions
In algebra, we use letters like ${x,}$ ${y,}$ ${n,}$ and ${m}$ to represent
numbers. We call such letters variables. When we combine these variables
with mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication,
etc., we have an expression. For example, the following are all
expressions:

- ${a + 2}$
- ${x^2}$
- ${\sqrt{x} - y}$
- ${\dfrac{x^{1/3} + x^2}{a/b}}$

When we place an equal sign between two expressions, we have an equation:

$$
	a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
$$

In mathematics, the equal sign is a symbol that expresses the relation
between mathematical objects. In the example above above, these objects are
expressions. When we place an equal sign between two expressions, we are
saying: The expression ${a^2 + b^2}$ is the same, in every way, as the
expression ${c^2.}$ This is a proposition. Notice its gravity. There are
very few things in the world that have that property &mdash; the same in
every way.

We will see in later sections that equality is just one kind of relation.
In fact, a significant portion of mathematics (if not most) concerns
inequations &mdash; propositions like ${x^2 < y^2.}$ We will revisit
inequations (also called inequalities) once we've established familiarity
with equations.

### The Domain of an Expression
All mathematical expressions have a domain &mdash; the set of all values
for which the expression is defined. Less formally, the domain of an
expression is essentially the boundaries of what we're discussing. For
example, if we were debating the costs and benefits of capitalism, the
debate might be limited to economies that exist today, rather than the
economies of ancient Egypt. The basic idea is that, outside of the domain,
the expression is undefined &mdash; all bets are off.

For example, the expression $3x + 4$ has a domain of $\mathbb{R}$, since it
is defined for all real numbers. We denote the domain of $3x + 4$ with the
notation: $dom(3x + 4) = \mathbb{R}$.
Example: What is the domain of $\dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)}$?

$$
\text{dom}\left(\dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)}\right) = \{t \in \mathbb{R} \mid t \neq 1, t \neq
-3\}
$$

We impose restrictions on the domain, since $t = 1$ and $t = -3$ lead to
the denominator evaluating to 0, which is undefined.
For example, what is the domain of $4x + 3x^{-1}$?

$$
\text{dom}\left(4x + \dfrac{3}{x}\right) = \{ \mathbb{R} \mid x \neq 0 \}
$$

### Truth Sets
Because expressions contain variables, an equation is true or false if, and
only if, we substitute values into those variables. Until then, an equation
is neither true nor false. If a value is inputted and the equation is true,
we call that value the solution, or root, of the equation. The set of all
roots to an equation is called the equation's truth set.

If an equation's truth set is the equation's domain, we say that equation
is an _identity_. For example, the equations:

- ${x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)}$
- ${\dfrac{4x^2}{x} = x}$

are identities. Both equations have a domain of $\mathbb{R}$, and
substituting $x$ with any real number will render the equations true.

### Open Sentences
Consider the following:

$$
	1 + x = 4
$$

The above is clearly an equation, but more broadly, it is called an **open
sentence** &mdash; a statement that contains a variable, and becomes a
proposition when an element of the universal set is substituted for the
variable. In this case, the universal set is the set of all real numbers,
${\reals.}$ If we substitute ${1,}$ an element of the universal set, into the
variable, we obtain ${1 + 1 = 2,}$ a false proposition. But, if we instead
substituted 3, another element of the universal set, we obtain
${1 + 3 = 4,}$ a true proposition.

Like propostions, we denote open sentences with lower-case letters, with
the one key difference &mdash; there is a subscript appended, corresponding
to the variables used in the open sentence. For example, the open sentence
above might be denoted ${p_x.}$

The rule of substituting remains applicable for variables that occur more
than once in the sentence:

$$
	1 + x + x = 2
$$

To return a true proposition for the sentence above, we must substitute a
value into each ${x}$ in the open sentence.

We call these statements open sentences because they are in fact sentences.
Equations, at the end of the day, are simply sentences. The equation
${2x = 3}$ is just another way of saying, &#8220;Two multiplied by some
value is three.&#8221; The use of the symbols 2, ${x,}$ ${=,}$ and ${3,}$
and arranging those symbols in a particular way, is nothing more than a
means of making things more concise and easier to read. Mathematicians
invent and use symbols because certain propositions cannot be expressed
concisely and clearly in plain English:

$$
	\int_0^{3.8}\frac{\pi^4 x y (a+9 c+8 b \cos(\frac{\pi z}{l})+18 c \cos(\frac{2 \pi z}{l})) \sin^2(\frac{\pi z}{l})}{l^4} dz
$$

&#8220;The ingegral with respect to ${z}$ from 0 to 3.8 of the quotient of
the product of the product of the fourth power of Pi, ${x,}$ and ${y}$
multiplied by the sum of ${a,}$ the product of ${8,}$ ${b,}$ and the cosine
of the quotient of the product of Pi and ${z}$ divided by ${l,}$ the
product of ${18,}$ ${c,}$ and the cosine of the quotient of 2, Pi, and
${z,}$ and the square of the sine of the quotient of Pi and ${z}$ divided
by ${l,}$ all divided by the the fourth power of ${l.}$&#8221;

### Families of Equations
Equations fall into several types. Mathematicians have constructed these
groupings because equations often share many properties. We will explore
what these properties are carefully, but before doing so, we have some
familiarity of the type names. The overview provided below is strictly
informal. We will provide more formal definitions when we address each type
of equation in turn.

#### Linear Equations
The linear equation is the simplest equation. Here are some examples of
linear equations:

- ${12x - 2 = 0}$
- ${19x = 24}$
- ${17x + 4y = z}$
- ${ax + by + nz = g}$

Notice that the number of variables doesn't prevent an equation from being
classified as a linear equation. Indeed, the only requirements for
something to be a linear equation is that each term is either a constant or
the product of a constant and a single variable. If the linear equation
consists of just one variable, we say that the equation is a linear
equation of one-variable. If there are two variables, it's a linear
equation of two-variables, and so on.

Despite their simplicity, linear equations are extremely important in both pure and applied mathematics. In physics, the distance an object travels, called displacement, is given by a linear equation: ${s = x_f - x_i,}$ where ${s}$ is the displacement, ${x_f}$ is the final position, and ${x_i}$ is the initial position. The final velocity of an object can also be determined by the equation ${v_f = v_0 + at,}$ where ${v_f}$ is the final velocity, ${v_0}$ is the initial velocity, ${a}$ is the acceleration, and ${t}$ is the time interval. These are both linear equations.

#### Polynomial Equations
Polynomial equations are equations consisting of polynomials &mdash;
expressions that consist of variables and coefficients where the
onperations involved are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
non-negative integer exponentiation. This is a bit of a mouthful, so here
are some examples of polynomial expressions:

- ${x^2 - 4x + 13}$
- ${x^2 + y^2}$
- ${bx^3}$
- ${2x}$

and here are some examples of polynomial equations:

- ${a^2 + b^2 = c^2}$
- ${\Delta x = v_0t + \dfrac{1}{2}at^2}$
- ${3x^2 - 9 = 0}$
- ${2x - 1 = 0}$

Wait a minute. Isn't that ${2x - 1 = 0}$ a linear equation? It is in fact a
linear equation. All linear equations are polynomial equations of degree-1.
But, not every polynomial equation is a linear equation. For example, a
polynomial equation of degree-2:

$$
	ax^2 + x + c = 0
$$

Put simply, the degree of a polynomial equation is the leading exponent in
the equation. A polynomial equation of degree-3:

$$
	ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0
$$

Because it's fairly cumbersome to write &#8220;of degree-${n}$&#8221; every
time, we have some special names for certain degrees. A quadratic equation
is a polynomial equation of degree-2. For example:

$$
	3x^2 + x - 9 = 0
$$

A cubic equation is a polynomial equation of degree-3:

$$
	4x^3 - x = 12
$$

A quartic equation is a polynomial equation of degree-4:

$$
	x^4 + 3x^3 - 9x^2 + 12 = 0
$$

Quartic equations are sometimes called biquadratic equations. We use the
term quartic because it's shorter to write.

Polynomial equations are also classified by the number of terms the
equation contains. A polynomial equation with only one term is called a
monomial. For example, ${x^2 = 0}$ is a monomial equation. A polynomial
equation with two terms is called a binomial. For example,
${a^2 + b^2 = 2}$ is a binomial equation. A polynomial equation with three
terms is called a trinomial &mdash; ${a^2 + b + c = 0.}$

##### Quadratic Equations
Quadratic equations are equations in one variable that can be written in
the form:

$$
	ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

If we seek to determine the the truth set of a quadratic equation (i.e.,
the set of all roots, or values of ${x}$ where the equation is true), our
first course of action is to factor. And whenever we factor, we should be
cognizant of the basic law of multiplication:

$$
pq = 0 \iff \begin{cases} p = 0, \text{ or } \\ q = 0, \text{ or } \\ p
= 0 \text{ and } q = 0 \end{cases}
$$

> Example: What is the value of ${x}$ in ${ 8x^2 - 3 = 10x?}$

Subtracting ${10x}$ from both sides, we get:

$$
	8x^x - 10x - 3 = 0
$$

Factoring:

$$
	(2x + 3)(4x + 1) = 0
$$

Solving for ${x}$ for one of the expressions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	2x + 3 &= 0 \\
	2x &= -3 \\
	x &= \frac{-3}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

And for the other expression:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	4x + 1 &= 0 \\
	4x &= -1 \\
	x &= \frac{-1}{4} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, we have:

$$
	x = \frac{-3}{2}, \frac{-1}{4}
$$

#### Trigonometric Equations
Many equations represent cycles, and wherever there are cycles, there's
likely a trigonometric operator involved. Such equations are called
trigonometric equations. These equations might look something like:

- ${\sin x + \cos y = z}$
- ${(\tan^2 x + 5) - \sin x = 0}$
- ${\arctan z - y^2 = x}$

#### Exponential Equations
Exponential equations look very much like polynomials, with the distinctive
feature that their exponents have variables instead. For example:

- ${y = e^x}$
- ${z = y^x - 24}$
- ${2^a + c = b^2}$

Exponential equations are often seen in mathematical models for population
growth and areas of finance.

#### Radical Equations
Radical equations have the distinctive feature of containing one or more
radicands or fractional exponents:

- ${y = \sqrt{x}}$
- ${a = b^{1/2}}$

#### Rational Equations
Finally, we have the rational equations. These are equations with rational
expressions or negative exponents:

- ${\dfrac{x}{4} = \dfrac{(y - 3)^2}{17}}$
- ${y = \dfrac{1}{x}}$
- ${f = n^{-1}}$

#### Conditional Equations
The opposite of an identity is a conditional equation. These are equations
that are true only if some condition(s) is/are true. For example, the
following are conditional equations:

- ${2x = 10}$
- ${x = x + 1}$

The equation $2x = 10$ is true only if it is true that $x = 5$. The
equation $x = x + 1$ is true only if there is some number that equals one
more than itself (a condition that can never be satisfied, so the equation
can never be true).

#### Equivalent Equations
Equivalent expressions are represented by expressions. Equations themselves
can be equivalent. Two equations are equivalent if, and only if, they have
exactly the same solutions.

#### Inequations
Most critical findings in mathematics result from inequalities rather than
equations. And understandibly so &mdash; it is often easier to determine
whether particular expressions are greater or less than others, in
comparison to concluding that they are equal. Whenever we replace the equal
sign in an equation with one of the symbols ${\leq}$ or ${\geq,}$ we obtain
an an __inequation__. Both equations and inequations are mathematical
statements. As such, inequations, like equations, have truth sets &mdash;
the set of all values that render the inequality true if any member of that
set is substituted into a variable, or variables, of the inequality.

For example, suppose ${2x - 3 < 8.}$ The value ${x = 5}$ would be a member
of the inequation's truth set, since ${2(5) - 3 = 7 < 8.}$ The value
${x = 10,}$ however, would not be a member of that truth set, since
${2(10) - 3 = 17 \nless 8.}$ We can find the entire truth set for the
inequation by solving for $x$, using the same techniques for equations:

$$
	2x - 3 < 8 = 2x - 3 + 3 < 8 + 3 \\
	2x < 8 + 3 \\
	2x < 11 \\
	x < \dfrac{11}{2} \\
$$

Although inequations can be solved by mostly applying the techniques for
equations, there are some situations we should take care when handling.
Particularly, we must be careful whenever we multiply or divide both sides
of an inequation by the same nonzero number.

For example, suppose ${1 < 3.}$ If we multiplied both sides of the
inequality by 10, we would obtain ${10 < 30.}$ Clearly this is true. But if
were to multiply both sides by -5, we would obtain ${-5 < -15.}$ This is
false. This observation returns 2 general rules:

> __lemma__. If both sides of an inequation are multiplied or divided by a
> positive real number, then the inequation is preserved.

> __lemma__. If both sides of an inequation are multiplied or divided by a
> negative real number, then the inequation is reversed.

More explicit rules:

> __lemma__. If ${a < b,}$ then ${a + c < b + c,}$ and ${a - c < b - c.}$

> __lemma__. If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^+,}$ then ${ac < bc,}$ and >
> ${\dfrac{a}{c} < \dfrac{b}{c}.}$

> __lemma__. ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^-,}$ then ${ac > bc,}$ and >
> ${\dfrac{a}{c} > \dfrac{b}{c}.}$

> __lemma__. If ${a < b}$ and ${b < c,}$ then ${a < c.}$


## Number Sets
Numbers have been around for a long time. Early humans used all sorts of
ways to record their enumerations: Scratches on cave walls and bones; knots
on strings; pebbles and shells; notches cut into twigs &mdash; all attempts
to quantify, to make sense of the environment. It's as if the numbers
revealed themselves magically.

But what is it really magic? Or was it purely out of necessity? The
intuitive response is that our ancestors needed to quantify objects.
Perhaps the earliest hunters needed to determine how much game was needed
for the village. Or the chief having to decide a fair tribute. But this
response neglects the fact that our forebears weren't just concerned with
survival. They were also deeply superstitious.

Some of the earliest forms of counting date to religious ceremonies and
mysticism. Many of these ceremonies required ordering participants and
events, hinting at the possibility that the ordinal numbers &mdash; numbers
used to denote position &mdash; came before the cardinal numbers &mdash;
numbers used for quantity.

Indeed, there's a plausible argument there. Some of the earliest forms of
the cardinal numbers were rudimentary and simple, in contrast to their
ordinal counterparts. Cardinal numbers were limited to ${2,}$ and anything
beyond that was a word for "many" or "lots." Moreover, the view that the
ordinals preceded the cardinals would be in line with the recurring
phenomenon of dividing the integers into "male" and "female," an idea that
would eventually lead to "odd" and "even."

Regardless of whether the ordinal or the cardinal came first, the human
need for numerating grew increasingly complex. And as complexity increased,
so too did our sophistication. Sticks, stones, and bones were too
ephemeral, so we developed number systems to more efficiently analyze our
states of affairs. As far back as 3600 BC, the Ancient Egyptians used a
numbering system where every ${10}$ unique characters could be abstracted,
or symbolized, by a new, unique character. The Egyptian system evidences
one of the earliest forms of a base-10 system, or decimal system. Unlike
the number system we're familiar with, the Ancient Egyptian number system
introduced a new symbol for every ${10}$ symbols. In other words, a symbol
for ${1,}$ then for every ten ${1s}$, a symbol for ${10,}$ then ${100,}$
then ${1,000,}$ then ${10,000,}$ then ${100,000,}$ and so on.

Centuries later, the Greeks concocted their own number system, where a
unique character for ${5}$ was introduced. The ancient Romans followed
suit, utilizing the familiar capital letter numerals now relegated to
formal headings and cryptic date tattoos. The numerals ${I,}$ ${II,}$ and
${III}$ are derived directly from using three fingers to symbolize ${3;}$
the numeral ${V}$ from the angle formed by all five fingers; and ${X}$ from
the joining of two ${V.}$ The numeral ${C}$ represented ${100,}$ and half
of a ${C}$ &mdash; an ${L}$ &mdash; represented ${50.}$ The numeral ${M}$
represented ${1,000.}$ Split it in half and turn it on its side, we obtain
something that looks like ${D,}$ the numeral for ${500.}$

The ancient Mayans too had a sophisticated and flourishing number system,
where dots and tallies were used as numerals. The beauty in the Mayan
system was its strong connection to addition. Numerals logically followed
from arithmetic. In contrast to the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the
ancient Mayans introduced a new, unique character for every ${20}$ symbols,
an example of a base-20 system, or vigesimal system. Moreover, like the
ancient Egyptians, the Mayans understood the need to represent zero and
assigned it a unique symbol &mdash; well before zero was accepted in
Europe.

Ancient China, whose characters made their way into the Korean peninsula
and the Japanese isles, developed a number system from a mixture of
pictographs and arithmetic. Unlike the Mayans and their connection to
addition, the Chinese number system draws directly from multiplication and
addition. By incorporating two arithmetic operators, the Chinese number
system allowed for a smaller set of numerals, which in turn permitted
efficient enumeration of large quantities.

The numerals we use today are the Hindu-Arabic numerals, derived from Hindu
and Arabic number systems. Developed about ${2,000}$ years ago in India,
the numerals made their way into Europe, via the Spanish peninsula. The
Moors (Spanish Muslims), in their search for trade, brought both the
Hindu-Arabic numerals and Ancient Greek philosophy, preserved by Arabic
scholars. In the 12th century, Leonardo Fibonacci, for whom the Fibonacci
numbers are named, furthered the numerals spread into continental Europe.
By the 15th century, the Roman numerals &mdash; until then the predominant
symbols &mdash; were entirely replaced by the Hindu-Arabic numerals we know
today.

All of this is to say that there is a distinction between a numeral and a
number. The numeral is purely a symbol. We could have just as easily
continued using Roman symbols to do mathematics, just as medieval Europeans
did. Understanding this distinction is crucial for when we study numbers.
The Chinese symbol 五 is different from the Hindu-Arabic symbol ${5}$, but
they both communicate the same idea &mdash; the number five. Often, we'll
find that numerals are inappropriate for a particular analysis because of
the underlying idea they communicate &mdash; a discrete number. In those
situations, we must let go of the numeral abstraction, and think in
different terms, different symbols, and different relationships. To do so
effectively, we study the properties of the real numbers.

### The Natural Numbers
We define the natural numbers as the positive integers including zero
(i.e., the nonnegative integers). These are what we refer to as the
counting numbers in regular speech. Importantly, mathematicians differ on
whether ${0}$ is a natural number. This is more a matter of convenience
than anything else, but in these materials, we follow the premise that
${0}$ is a natural number. If there is a variation, we will explicitly
state that ${0}$ is not included in the set.

$$\nat = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots \} $$

Some texts define the natural numbers as the positive integers, and instead
refer to the nonnegative integers as the whole numbers. For reasons beyond
the scope of the current discussion, defining the natural numbers as
including zero has benefits for later sections.

### Integers
The integers are the numbers we use for counting (also called the cardinal
numbers in other contexts), and their negatives. They are denoted with the
special symbol, ${\uint,}$ from the German zehr, meaning "number".

${ \uint = \{ \ldots , \texttt{-}4, \texttt{-}3, \texttt{-}2, \texttt{-}1, 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \} }$

Some elementary mathematical texts call the counting numbers the whole
numbers, and go so far as to denote them with the symbol ${\mathbb{W}.}$
This terminology is seldom used in higher level mathematics, so we'll stick
to the more common integers. Nevertheless, the idea of a whole number is
helpful for communicating the notion of an integer, so we'll momentarily
use it.

But what is a whole number? We can think of the whole number as such: If a
number has at least one non-zero digit after its decimal point, then it is
not a "whole number" because we cannot count from or to zero with that
number exactly 1 unit at a time on the number line. For example, ${1.1}$ is
not a whole number, because no matter how much we try, to get to zero, we
have to subtract ${0.1.}$ This is not 1 unit, so it does not constitute a
whole number. And since it does not constitute a whole number, it is not an
integer.

The whole numbers greater than ${0}$ are called the positive integers. We
can think of these numbers as the numbers we use to count forwards (e.g.,
inserting a certain amount of objects into a space).

$$
	\uint^{+} = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \}
$$

Notice symbol for the set, a zehr with a superscripted plus sign. And the
whole numbers less than ${0}$ are called the negative integers. Here, we
can think of these numbers as the numbers we use to count backwards (e.g.,
removing a certain number of objects from a space).

$$
	\uint^{-} = \{ \ldots , \texttt{-}4, \texttt{-}3, \texttt{-}2, \texttt{-}1 \}
$$

The number ${0}$ is neither negative nor positive. It has a special
duality: It is both a non-positive and non-negative number. The
non-positive integers are negative integers including zero:

$$
	\Z_{\leq 0} = \{ \ldots , \texttt{-}4, \texttt{-}3, \texttt{-}2, \texttt{-}1, 0 \}
$$

and the non-negative integers are the positive integers including zero:

$$
	\Z_{\geq 0} = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \}.
$$

### Rational Numbers

When we divide one integer by another nonzero integer, we get a **rational
number**. Specifically, if, and only if, a number can be written in the
form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ is an integer and $b$ is a nonzero integer,
then the number is a rational number. For example, 4 is a rational number,
since 4 can be written as $\frac{4}{1}$. 0.5 is a rational number, since it
can be written as $\frac{1}{2}$.

### Irrational Numbers
If a number cannot be written in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ is an integer and $b$ is a nonzero integer, then the number is an _irrational number_. For example, the number $\pi$ is an irrational number, because it cannot be written in the form $\frac{a}{b}$.

### Real Numbers
${1, 3.14, \pi, \phi, e, 4}$ and ${0,}$ all of these numbers are called _real numbers_. In the simplest terms, a real number is a number that can be written as a decimal. Thus, 7 is a real number, since ${7 = 7.0.}$ Similarly, while ${\pi}$ is an irrational number. It is a real number since it can be written as a decimal (${3.14 \ldots}$), albeit non-terminating.

Real numbers are written in _decimal notation_. This is the prevailing
standard (with the exception of _binary_, favored by computers). The
decimal system is useful because it allows us to quickly add numbers
through the process of _carrying over_.

### Complex Numbers
Outside of the real numbers, we have the imaginary numbers. These are the
numbers that result from operations such as $\sqrt{\texttt{-}1}$. We will treat
and analyze this numbers in a separate chapter.


### Laws of Arithmetic
The following materials discuss arithmetic, the set of rules and
conventions governing the manipulation of numbers. The word arithmetic is
derived from the Greek arithmetike, meaning "art of counting," which is
itself derived from the Greek arithmos, meaning "number."

There are four basic arithmetic operators:

| Symbol         | Operation      |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| $a + b$        | Addition       |
| $a - b$        | Subtraction    |
| $a \times b$   | Multiplication |
| $\dfrac{a}{b}$ | Division       |
| $a^b$          | Exponentiation |

Above, we used the letters $a$ and $b$. These are called variables. They
are simply placeholders that we can plug numbers, other variables, or even
other operations with variables into. Variables allow us to generalize, or
abstract, statements. For example, ${2 + 2 = 4}$, and ${3 + 8 = 11}$. We
make an abstraction of this pattern, or idea, by writing something like
${a + b = n.}$ This communicates the idea, "The number ${n}$ is the sum of
${a}$ and ${b.}$"

There are many ways to read an equation, but they all express the same
idea. The human mind, however, is a peculiar thing. Often, reading and
writing the same equation in different ways can lead to drastically
different insights. Consider all the different ways we can read
${a + b = n:}$ The sum of ${a}$ and ${b}$ is ${n.}$ The number ${n}$ is the
sum of ${a}$ and ${b.}$ The numbers ${a}$ and ${b}$ such that the sum is
${n.}$ The number ${b}$ is the difference of ${n}$ and ${a.}$

All of this is to say that addition and subtraction are just fast and
flexible ways to express counting forwards and backwards. For example, the
expression ${4 + 8}$ is just another way of saying "Count ${8}$ positions
from ${4}$." This leads to: ${5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.}$ This in turn is
just another way of saying "Count ${12}$ positions from ${0}$" or "Count
${1}$ position from ${11.}$" Notice that with these addition (and
subtraction), we are just offsetting from one or the other of the operands.
${1 + 1}$ is simply "1 offset 1," which is ${2.}$

All of this evidences that addition and subtraction are abstractions of
counting. Abstractions are useful because they allow us greater flexibility
and accuracy with our statements. Suppose we want to say, "I'm looking for
two numbers that add to 10." We can write: $a + b = 10$. This flexibility
and accuracy is a powerful tool in mathematics, because it gives us plenty
of room to write statements that say what we can and cannot do &mdash;
rules.

Understanding the basic rules of arithmetic at a very high level is
priceless in mathematics. Part of the elegance and power of mathematics is
that we can arrive at beautiful, and often shocking, results from a set of
very basic rules.

### Order of Operations
Arithmetic allows us to combine numbers, through the operations listed
above, to form other numbers. The way we order operations matters in
mathematics. Otherwise, we run into problems. For example, consider the
following:

$$
   2 + 3 \times 4
$$

What does this expression mean? Well, it could be: (1) Add 2 and 3, then
(2) multiply the sum by 4. Or, it could mean: (1) Multiply 3 and 4, and (2)
add 2 to the product. This ambiguity is unacceptable in mathematics. We
need be clear and precise with our words. For these reason, mathematics
follows a few conventions on how to write mathematical expressions:

1. Evaluate expressions in parentheses first, working from the inner most
   to the outer most, applying the rules below.
2. Perform all exponentiations.
3. Perform all multiplications and divisions from left to right.
4. Perform all additions and subtractions from left to right.

The conventions above are collectively called the __order of operations__.
Again, these are conventions. They are not universal truths; they're simply
what mathematicians have come to agree to about how mathematics is
communicated and understood.

## Addition

Addition can be thought of as moving to the right along the real number
line by whatever number we are adding. So, for example, the expression
${4 + 2}$ can be thought of as "Start at 4, and move 2 to the right." This
give us the final destination of 6. Subtraction is really just addition,
only instead of moving towards the right, we move towards the left. For
example, $4 - 3$ is really $4 + (-3)$, returning 1. Visually:

### Identity Property of Real Addition
Pius, a bank robber, goes to Ultimate Safety Bank, and robs it. He leaves
with 4,000 dollars. Pius then goes to another bank Safer Bank, 4,000
dollars and fake gun in hand, and tells the teller to put the money in the
bag. The teller takes the bag, disappears below the counter, and pretends
to place money in the bag; the teller, in fact, didn't place anything in
the bag. She returns the bag, and Pius sprints out the building to his
e-scooter, and zooms away. He gets home and opens the bag. How much money
does Pius have?

Pius starts with 0, then takes 4,000 from Ultimate Safety, then goes to
Safer Bank, and gets 0. When we add 0 to a number, we are effectively
saying "no movement" along the number line. Thus, we have the following
rule:

> __~identity property of addition~__. Given ${a \in \reals,}$ it follows that ${a + 0 = 0 + a = a.}$

### Real Subtraction

Knowing whether operands are negative or positive can allow us to
immediately conclude certain propositions. First, the sum of two positive
integers is a positive integer.

> __~theorem~__. If ${a, b \in \reals,}$ then ${a + b \in \reals.}$

From the rule property above, we have a further property: The sum of two
negative numbers is a negative number.

> __~theorem~__. If ${a, b \in \reals^{-},}$ then ${a + b \in \reals^{-}.}$

The operation of subtraction is not exactly an independent operation.
Really, subtraction is just addition with a negative. The "operation" of
subtraction is really just a shorthand way for writing out addition of
positive and negative numbers. For example, when we write ${a + (-b),}$< we
instead just write ${a - b.}$ It's just a faster way of writing the same
expression.

The identity property of addition leads to the additive inverse. As
aforementioned, subtraction is really just adding negative numbers.
Considering the addition with zero rule, we have the following inference:

> __~additive inverse~__. Given ${a \in \reals,}$ ${a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0}$

Given the equation ${a + (-a) = 0}$, we say that ${-a}$ is the additive
inverse of ${a.}$ Whenever we see the equation ${-a + a = 0}$, we should
immediately become aware that we ${a}$ and ${-a}$ are on opposite sides of
0 on the real line. Furthermore, because ${-a + a = 0}$, subtracting ${-a}$
from both sides, we have ${-a =
-(-a)}$.

The additive inverse also allows us to draw another inference. Given the
equation ${a + x = a,}$ we should immediately know that ${x = 0.}$
Similary, if we see the equation ${a + x = 0,}$ then we should immediately
know that ${x = -a.}$

### Commutativity of Real Addition

The commutative law of addition states that:

$$
	a + b = b + a
$$

In other words, the order of the terms in an addition expression does not
change the sum of those terms. We call the property above more generally as
__commutativity__. One way to remember it: In addition, terms can
"commute."" In other words, the terms can move around as they please, as
long as they stay within addition (and as we'll see later, multiplication).

The idea is made apparent from a simple analogy. If we want sweet iced tea,
we can: add the tea, then the ice, then the sugar; or we can add the sugar,
then the ice, then the tea; or we can add the tea, then the sugar, then the
ice, and so on and so forth. Either or, the result is the same &mdash;
sweet iced tea.[^tea]

[^tea]:
    Granted, greater minds may differ on how sweet iced tea should be made.

### Associative Law of Addition

The associative law of addition states that the sum of the terms does not
depend on the grouping of the terms. In other words, we can group the terms
however way we'd like.

> __~associative property of addition~__. If ${a, b, c \in \reals,}$ then ${a + b + c = (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).}$

We call the property above more generally as _associativity_. We can
remember it as: In addition, the terms are free to _associate_. In other
words, the terms can gather together or separate as they please, as long as
they stay within addition (and again, as we'll see later, multiplication).

From the definition above, if we have the expression ${a + b + c + d,}$ we
can generate numerous different possibilities:

$$
	a + b + c + d \\
	a + b + c + d \\
	a + (b + c + d) \\
	a + (b + (c + d)) \\
	a + b + (c + d)
$$

All these possibilities are equivalent, but some may be easier to compute
than others. The associative law of addition leads to another useful
property:

> __~theorem~__. If $a + b = 0$, then $b = -a$ and $a = -b$.

The above property is the direct result of subtracting either $a$ or $b$
from both sides. Associativity and commutativity are what allow us to
rewrite expressions in numerous different ways:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(a - b) + c &= (a + (-b)) + c \\
&= a + (-b + c) ~\text{by associativity} \\
&= a + (c - b) ~\text{by commutativity} \\
&= (a + c) - b ~\text{by associativity}
\end{aligned}
$$

Importantly, the associative property of addition does not apply to
subtraction. For example, ${a - b}$ does not imply that ${b - a.}$
${a - b}$ is equivalent to ${a + (-b),}$ but it is not equivalent to
${b + (-a).}$ The proposition ${a - b = b - a}$ is true iff ${a = b.}$

### The Cancellation Law of Addition
The Cancellation Law for Addition Suppose we have the following
relationship:

$$
	a + b = a + c
$$

Subtracting ${ a }$ from both sides, we have ${ a + b - a = a + c - a }$.
Simplifying, we have: ${ b = c }$.

> __~cancellation law of addition~__. If ${ a + b = a + c }$, then ${ b = c }$.

## Closure

> __~property~__. Let ${a, b \in \reals}$ then ${a + b \in \reals}$ and ${a \cdot b \in \reals.}$

From the property above, we say that the reals are _closed_ under addition and multiplication. In other words, if we add two reals numbers, then the sum is a real number. If we multiply two real numbers, then the product is real number.
We can draw a few other useful properties.

## Inequalities

Inequalities arguably appear more often than equalities in mathematics.
This is because equality imposes an extraordinarily high burden of proof:
When we write ${a = b,}$ we are implying that ${a}$ and ${b}$ are the same
in every possible way. Because of that burden, we often must speak in terms
of relativity, using the symbols
${ <, >, \leq, \geq, \nless, \ngtr, \nleq, \ngeq.}$ Let's discuss how each
of these symbols are used and the propositions they can express.

First, when we write ${a < b,}$ we are stating, ${a}$ is greater than
${b.}$\_ The same proposition can be written as ${b < a.}$

Second, if ${a < 0,}$ we say that ${a}$ is __negative__. If ${a > 0,}$ we
say that ${a}$ is __positive__.

Third, the inequality symbols operate similarly to the equal sign: There
are two sides, and we can manipulate the expression accordingly &mdash; so
long as the expression remains true. For example, consider the proposition
${a > b.}$ We can manipulate this expression as such:

$$
	\begin{aligned} a &> b \\ a - b &> b - b \\ a - b &> 0 \end{aligned}
$$

We see that given the expression ${a > b,}$ it follows that ${a - b}$ is
positive. This analysis leads to several laws. First, the **Trichotomy
law**:

> _Trichotomy Law_. For every ${a \in \reals,}$ one, and only one, of the
> following propositions is true: ${a = 0}$ ${a \in \reals^{+}}$ >
> ${-a \in \reals^{+}}$

The rule above tells us that every real number ${a}$ can be only one of
three things: zero, positive, or negative. Those are the only three
possible states. Nothing else. Additionally, we have the **laws of
closure**. We can think of these laws as defining the boundaries of
addition and multiplication. First, the __law of closure under addition__:

> _Closure Under Addition._ If ${a}$ and ${b}$ are in ${R^{+},}$ then
> ${a + b}$ is in ${R^{+}.}$

And the __law of closure under multiplication__:

> _Closure Under Multiplication._ If ${a}$ and ${b}$ are in ${R^{+},}$ then
> ${a \cdot b}$ is in ${R^{+}.}$

Complementing the laws above, we have the following definitions:

> _Definition._ Given any two numbers ${a}$ and ${b,}$ the following
> propositions hold:
>
> 1. ${a - b \in \reals^{+} \nc a > b}$
> 2. ${b > a \nc a}$
> 3. ${(a > b) \lor (a = b) \nc a \geq b}$
> 4. ${a > 0 \iff a \in \reals^{+}}$

As a consequence of the definitions above, we have:

> __definition__. Given any two numbers ${a}$ and ${b,}$ exactly one of the
> following propositions is true:
> * ${a - b = 0,}$ 
> * ${a - b > 0,}$ xor
> * ${-(a - b) = b - a > 0}$

Manipulating the above definitions, we have:

> Definition. Given any two numbers ${a}$ and ${b,}$ exactly one of the
> following propositions is true: ${a = b,}$ ${a > b,}$ xor ${b > a}$

That is to say, given any numbers ${a}$ and ${b,}$ one is less than or
equal to the other.

## Multiplication

Multiplication is simply repeated addition. Accordingly, we can think of
multiplication as an even faster method of counting. For example,
${2 \cdot 2}$ is just another way of saying "Move 2 positions 2 times
forward, from the origin." This leads to 4. Similarly,
${2 \cdot \texttt{-}3}$ is equivalent to, "Move 2 positions 3 timees
backward, from the origin." This leads to ${\texttt{-}6.}$ This reveals
that whenever we write the expression ${a \cdot b,}$ there's an implicit
${(a \cdot b) + 0.}$ Whenever we multiply integers, the following rule
holds true:

> _Closure Property of Multiplication_. The product of two integers is an
> integer.

### Laws of Multiplication

Like addition, there are several laws of multiplication. These are
equivalent to the laws of addition with just a few differences.

#### Commutative Law of Multiplication.

The commutative law of multiplication states that we the order in which we
multiply two real numbers ${a}$ and ${b}$ doesn't affect the result. In
other words, we can freely move terms around and arrive at the same
product.[^mnemonic]

[^mnemonic]:
    A helpful mnemonic for the commutative law: "Factors freely flow."

> _Commutative Property of Multiplication._ >
> ${a \cdot b = b \cdot a = (a)(b) = (b)(a)}$

#### Reciprocal Law of Multiplication

What is the result of ${2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}?}$ Clearly, it is ${1.}$ How
about ${3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}?}$ It's also ${1.}$ Indeed,
${n \cdot \dfrac{1}{n}}$ will always return ${1,}$ where ${n}$ is a real
number. We call this the _reciprocal law of multiplication_:

> _Reciprocal Law of Multiplication._ Given any ${n \neq 0,}$ there exists
> a number ${n^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{n}}$ such that:
> $$n \cdot n^{-1} = n^{-1} \cdot n = 1$$

While we haven't covered exponents yet, the notation ${n^{\texttt{-}1}}$ is
the same as the expression ${\dfrac{1}{n}}$. We call the number
${n^{\texttt{-}1}}$ the __reciprocal__ or the __multiplicative inverse__ of
the number ${n.}$ The law above tells us that multiplying a real number by
its reciprocal always yields the number ${1,}$ as long as that real number
isn't ${0.}$ Why not ${0?}$ Because if ${n = 0,}$ then we would have the
reciprocal ${\dfrac{1}{0}.}$ And for our purposes, division by ${0}$ is
always _undefined_.

#### Associative Law of Multiplication

The associative law of multiplication tells us that we can group factors
however way we'd like, and still arrive at the same
product.[^assocmnemonic]

[^assocmnemonic]:
    A helpful mnemonic for the associative law: "Factors freely faction."

> _Associative Property of Multiplication._ ${ (ab)c = a(bc)}$

The laws of commutativity and associativity apply whether ${ a }$, ${ b }$,
and ${ c }$ are negative, positive, or 0.

#### Multiplication by Zero

A man goes to a café and asks the barista for a Bombón. The barista asks,
"How many tablespoons of sugar would you like?" The man replies,
"Zero."[^kantfootnote]

Question: How many table spoons of sugar would the man get? Very clearly
zero! Zero of something is zero. We state this property of multiplication
formally:

> _Zero Property of Multiplication._ Given any real number ${a,}$ >
> ${0 \cdot a = 0}$

[^kantfootnote]:
    As an aside, the coffee example above is a play on the philosopher
    Slavoj Zizek's joke:

        A man comes into a restaurant. He sits down at the table and he says, “Waiter, bring me a cup of coffee without cream.” Five minutes later, the waiter comes back and says, “I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream. Can it be without milk?”

    Zizek's joke is an attempt at revitilizing Hegelian logic through an
    alternative reading. The idea is that the existence of a negation can
    be just as significant and worthy of consideration as the negation
    itself. In other words, when we encounter the proposition "coffee
    without cream", it's just as important to consider the possibility that
    what's being expressed is not "coffee _without cream_", but rather
    "coffee _without_".

    This idea has its roots in Kant's essay _An Attempt to Introduce the
    Concept of Negative Magnitudes of Philosophy._ There, Kant presented a
    thought experiment: Two equal forces start at zero. One moves five feet
    to the right, the other moves five feet to the left. Is the zero
    resulting from their movement different from the zero they started at?
    Kant argued yes, they are different. The "zero" resulting from the two
    forces cancelling one another is different from the zero before any
    force moved. The ${+5}$ and the ${-5}$ have in themselves a ${0,}$ in
    that ${+5}$ means "Move 5 to the right from ${0}$" and ${-5}$ means
    "Move 5 to the left from ${0.}$" That inherent ${0}$ never went
    anywhere. It's always been there.

    Hegel took this several steps further by arguing that the zero we get
    from ${5 + (-5)}$ is not only different, but that the process of
    negation alters the very thing we're negating. ${5 + (-5)}$ results in
    a non-being ${0,}$ from a process that starts with a being, the origin
    ${0.}$ This is the act of _negation_, and its result is different from
    zero, which represents nothingness. In Hegel's view, nothingness is
    always there. It requires no action by another to "be". In contrast,
    negation &mdash; the act of ${(5) + (-5)}$ &mdash; requires an action
    by another.

    Hegel's arguments on negation (and logic in general), no doubt had an
    impact on mathematical logic. In particular, Hegel's formulation of the
    _absolute_ (a concept that follows from his work on negations) is
    contemporaneous with the concept of _absolute value_, a topic to be
    discussed in later sections.

    The zero property of multiplication may seem straightforward, but it
    leads a particularly useful fact to keep in mind. The equation
    ${a \cdot b = a \cdot c}$ does not immediately imply that ${b = c.}$
    Why? Because if ${a = 0,}$ then either ${b}$ or ${c}$ could be any real
    number and ${b \neq c.}$ Never assume that ${ab = ac}$ implies
    ${b = c}$ without first verifying, or stating explicitly, that
    ${a \neq 0.}$

    Additionally, if we know that ${a \cdot b = 0,}$ then we have three
    possibilities: (1) ${a = 0,}$ (2) ${b = 0,}$ or (3) ${a = 0}$ and
    ${b = 0.}$

#### Identity Property of Multiplication

Ayuri is about to walk to a smoke shop to buy some flavored tobacco. She
asks her roommate Elena, "Do you want any flavored tobacco?" looking for
flavored tobacco. Elena responds, "I do need some flavored tobacco." "What
would you like?" Ayuri asks. Elena answers, "Surprise me." At the smoke
shop, Ayuri asks the shopkeeper what flavors of tobacco the shop has. The
shopkeeper says, "There are 100 flavors &mdash; tobacco, mint, mango, lemon
... " enumerating each. After several minutes, Ayuri responds, "One of
each!" Ayuri returns home with a heavy bag, greeted by her roommate Elena
with, "Good grief, how many did you buy?" Ayuri stares, "100 I think.".

The computation above is governed by the **identity law of
multiplication**. More formally:

> _Identity Law of Multiplication._ Given ${a \in \reals,}$ then:
> ${1 \cdot a = a.}$

The above rules allow us to perform elaborate simplifications:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	(2a)(5b) &= 2(a(5b)) ~\text{by associativity}\\
	&= 2(5a)b ~\text{by commutativity}\\
	&= ( 2 \cdot 5 )ab ~\text{by associativity}\\
	&= 10ab
\end{aligned}
$$

The above example represents a useful technique when handling expressions
involving multiple factors: group all of the integers into a single
multiplication expression, and all of the variables elsewhere.

~example~. Numbers consisting entirely of the digit "8" are added, resulting in the sum 1000. What are these numbers?

First, assume the following:

$$
	\begin{matrix}
	\begin{alignedat}{8}
		\ldots 8 \\\ldots \\ + \space \ldots 8 \\ \hline 1000
	\end{alignedat}
	\end{matrix}
$$

What we know: Each number ends with an 8. Since the sum is 1000, the sum
of the last digit, an 8, is 0.

~example~. How many 8s do we need to arrive at a sum where the last digit is 0?  At least five 8s, since $8 \times 5 = 40$. Thus, we have:

$$
	\begin{matrix}
	\begin{alignedat}{8} \ldots 8 \\ \ldots 8 \\ \ldots 8 \\ \ldots 8 \\ + \space \ldots 8 \\ \hline 1000
	\end{alignedat}
	\end{matrix}
$$

Now note that there is a 4 that must be carried to the next place. To
keep the sum's digits 0, we need a sum of 8s and a 4 that returns the
last digit 0. We know that $8 + 8 + 4 = 20$. Further, we need one more 8
to get a 10:

$$
	\begin{matrix} \begin{alignedat}{8} 8 \\ 8 \\ 8 \\ 88 \\ + \space 888 \\ \hline 1000 \end{alignedat} \end{matrix}
$$

Thus, the numbers are 8, 8, 8, 88, and 888.

~example~. Suppose the following:

$$
	\begin{matrix} \begin{align*} AAA \\ + \space BBB \\ \hline AAAC
	\end{align*} \end{matrix}
$$

The ${As}$ denote some digit, the ${Bs}$ denote another digit, and ${Cs}$ denotes a third digit. What are these digits? To start, we are looking for a number where $A + B = nC$, where $n$ and $C$ are digits. Furthermore, $A + B + n = mA$, where $m$ and $A$ are digits. Then, $m + A + B = AAA$. Next, we note that $A + B$ must result in a two digit number. Second, we further note that $A$ appears in the thousands position of the result ($AAAC$). Because $A$ appears in the thousands place, no other digit can be carried over into the thousands place. There is only one number for $B$ that can satisfy these conditions: 9.

$$
	\begin{align*}
	111 \\ + \space 999 \\ \hline 1110
	\end{align*}
$$

~example~. Daniel claims that he can multiply any three-digit number by 1001 instantly. If his friend, Helga, says to him, "715" he gives the answer immediately. Compute his answer and explain Daniel's secret.

First, $715 \times 1001 = 715715$. We can see this with the
multiplication algorithm:

$$
	\begin{array}{cc} & & & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \times & & & & 7 & 1 & 5
	\\ \hline & & & 5 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ & & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ + & 7 & 0 & 0
	& 7 \\ \hline & 7 & 1 & 5 & 7 & 1 & 5 \end{array}
$$

Under the multiplication algorithm, Daniel simply takes the three
digits, ABC, and performs the following:

$$
	C00C \\
	B00B \\
	A00A
$$

Then, he adds the numbers, shifting one place to the left on each line:

$$
	\begin{array}{cc} & & & C & 0 & 0 & C \\ & & B & 0 & 0 & B \\ + &
	A & 0 & 0 & A \\ \hline & A & B & C & A & B & C \end{array}
$$

The result then is $ABCABC$, a repetition of the digits $ABC$. Note
further that there are two 0s, and the digits are repeated twice.

~example~. Compute $1010101010 \times 57$. The multiplication algorithm tells us that we are simply shifting the number 57 over and over, but, with an added 0, since the the first place does not shift:

$$
	\begin{array}{cc} & 01 & 01 & 01 & 01 & 01 & 01 \\ & & & & & & 57
	\\ \hline & & 57 & 57 & 57 & 57 & 57
	\end{array}
$$

Thus, the product is 5757575757.

~example~. Compute $10001 \times 1020304050$.  Solution We can compute this with the following:

$$
	\begin{array}{cc} & & & 10 & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 \\ \times & & & &
	& 01 & 00 & 01 \\ \hline & & & 10 & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 \\ & & 00 & 00
	& 00 & 00 & 00 & 00 \\ + & 10 & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 \\ \hline & 10 &
	20 & 40 & 60 & 80 & 40 & 50 \end{array}
$$

Thus, the product is 10204060804050.

~example~. Compute $11111 \times 1111$. Rewriting the expression with the multiplication algorithm:

$$
	\begin{array}{cc} & & & & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \times & & & & & 1
	& 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline & & & & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ & & & 1 & 1 & 1 &
	1 & 1 \\ & & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ + & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline &
	1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \end{array}
$$


## Distributivity

With the rules thus far, we can make even further inferences. We know that if ${ a + b = 0 }$, then ${ a = -b }$ and ${ b = -a }$. Thus, if ${ a + b = 0 }$, then it must be true that ${ (a + b) + (-a - b) = 0 }$, since ${ a + b = 0 }$ and ${ -a - b = 0 }$. If ${ (a + b) + (-a-b) = 0 }$, then it follows that ${ a + b - a -b = 0 }$. Rearranging the equation, we have ${ a - a + b - b = 0 }$. Rearranging again, we have: ${ -(a + b) = -a + (-b) }$. This yields the following inference:

$$
-(a + b) = -a - b
$$

Note that we should always be vigilant about distributing a minus sign to a
sum involving negative numbers: ${ -(-a) = a }$. To ensure that vigilance,
we should make the following rules clear:

> __~lemma~__. If ${a,b \in \reals}$ and ${ b }$ are positive integers, then ${a+b}$
> is a positive integer.

> __~lemma~__. If ${a}$ and ${b}$ ${\reals^-}$, then ${ a + b \in \reals^-.}$

We can see that these rules are true with a simple proof. Let ${ a = -n }$ and ${ b = -m }$, where ${ m }$ and ${ n }$ are positive. It follows then that ${ a + b = -n - m = -(n + m) }$. Since ${ n }$ and ${ m }$ are positive, ${ n + m }$ is positive. Since ${ n + m }$ is positive, it follows that ${ a + b }$ is negative, because ${ n + m }$ is positive only if ${ a + b }$ is negative. This analysis hints at another law, the _distributive property._

> __~distributive property~__. If ${a, b, c \in \reals,}$ then:
> ${a(b + c) = ab + ac}$

With the distribute property, we have another way of proving that
${a \cdot 0 = 0:}$

$$
\begin{aligned} (a \cdot 0) + (a \cdot 0) &= a \cdot (0 + 0) \\ &= a
\cdot 0 \end{aligned}
$$

The distributive property is also what leads to what at first appears to be
a mysterious rule: The product of two negative numbers is a positive
number. First, we start by proving that ${(-a)(b) = -(a \cdot b):}$

$$
\begin{aligned} (-a)(b) + (a)(b) &= ((-a) + a)(b) \\ &= (0)(b) \\ &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Because ${(-a)(b) = -(a \cdot b),}$ we can make the following inferences.
First, the factor ${(-a)(b) = -(ab).}$ Adding ${-(ab)}$ to both sides:

$$
\begin{aligned} (-a)(-b) + (-(ab)) &= (-a)(-b) + (-ab) \\ &= (-a) \cdot
((-b) + b) \\ &= (-a) \cdot 0 \\ &= 0 \end{aligned}
$$

Adding ${(a)(b)}$ to both sides:

$$
(-a)(-b) = (a)(b)
$$

Multiplying ${37 \cdot 25 \cdot 4,}$ we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	37 \cdot 25 \cdot 4 &= 37 \cdot (25 \cdot 4)
	&= 37 \cdot (100) \\
	&= 3700 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Anoter example: Multiply ${125 \cdot 37 \cdot 8}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
	125 \cdot 37 \cdot 8 = (25 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 2) \cdot 37 \\
	= (100 \cdot 10) \cdot 37 \\
	= (1000) \cdot 37 \\
	= 37000
\end{aligned}
$$

## Multivariable Relationships

Suppose we know the following relationship:

$$
	a + b = c
$$

Three number relationships are ripe for inferences. If we add ${ -b }$ to
both sides of the equation, we obtain ${ a + b - b = c - b }$. Simplifying,
we have ${ a + 0 = c - b }$. We can then infer:

$$
	a = c - b \\
	b = c - a
$$

~example~. Add 357 + 17999 + 1 without paper and pencil.

$$
\begin{aligned}
	357 + 17999 + 1 &= 357 + (17999 + 1)\\
	&= 357 + (18000)\\
	&= 18357
\end{aligned}
$$

~example~. Add 899 + 1343 + 101 without paper and pencil.

$$
\begin{aligned}
	899 + 1343 + 101 &= (899 + 1) + 1343 + (101 - 1) \\
	&= (900) + 1343 + (100) \\
	&= (1000) + 1343 \\
	&= 2343
\end{aligned}
$$

~example~. ${ (a + b) + (c + d) = (a + d) + (b + c) }$

$$
	\begin{aligned}
	(a + b) + (c + d) &= (a + d + b + c) ~\text{by commutativity} \\
	&= (a + d) + (b + c) ~\text{by associativity}
	\end{aligned}
$$

~example~. Prove: ${ (a + b) + (c + d) = (a + c) + (b + d) }$

$$
	\phantom{(a + b) + (c + d)} = (a + b + c + d) ~\text{by associativity} \\
	\phantom{(a + b) + (c + d)} = (a + c + b + d) ~\text{by commutativity} \\
	\phantom{(a + b) + (c + d)} = (a + c) + (b + d) ~\text{by associativity}
$$

~example~. Prove: ${(a - b) + (c - d) = (a + c) + (-b - d).}$ Following the rule ${n - m = n + (-m),}$ ${(a - b) + (c - d) = (a + (-b)) + (c + (-d))}$. Then, by associativity, ${(a + (-b)) + (c + (-d)) = a + (-b) + c + (-d)}$. By commutativity, ${a + (-b) + c + (-d) = (a + c) + ((-b) + (-d)).}$ Following the rule ${n - m = n + (-m)}$, it follows that ${(a + c) + ((-b) + (-d)) = (a + c) + (-b - d).}$ Therefore, ${(a - b) + (c - d) = (a + c) + (-b - d).}$


### Expansions
There are some expansions that every student in mathematics should know. An
__expansion__ is just a way of rewriting &mdash; expanding &mdash; a
shortened expression. The expansions are the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	(a + b)^2 &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\
	(a - b)^2 &= a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \\
	(a + b)(a - b) &= a^2 - b^2
\end{aligned}
$$


### The Multiplication Algorithm
The law of distributivity is what leads to the
multiplication algorithm we're all farmiliar with from elementary school.
The multiplication algorithm allows us to compute large numbers without the
need for memorization. For example, ${17 \times 38}$:

$$
\begin{array}{cc} & \space & 1 & 7 & \\ & \times & 3 & 8 & \\ \hline &
1 & 3 & 6 & \\ + & 5 & 1 \\ \hline & 6 & 4 & 6 & \end{array}
$$

Similarly:

$$
\begin{array}{cc} & \space & 3 & 8 & \\ & \times & 1 & 7 & \\ \hline &
2 & 6 & 6 & \\ + & 3 & 8 \\ \hline & 6 & 4 & 6 & \end{array}
$$

The algorithm above is really an embodiment of applying the distributive
property:

$$
\begin{aligned} 17 \times 38 &= 17 \times (3 \times 10 + 8) \\ &= (17
\times 3 \times 10) + (17 \times 8) \\ &= 510 + 136 \\ &= 646
\end{aligned}
$$

## Exponentiation

We can get by with the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division alone. However, having just these operations would be
particularly cumbersome for many mathematical statements. Consider for
example, the following expression:

$$
xxxxxxx + xxx
$$

This is difficult to parse, and delimiting with parentheses and operator
symbols is no better:

$$
(x)(x)(x)(x)(x)(x)(x) + (x)(x)(x)
$$

$$
x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x + x \cdot x \cdot x
$$

Even worse:[^zenzizenzic]

$$
xxxxxxx \times xxx = xxxxxxxxxx
$$

[^zenzizenzic]:
    As an aside, the eighth power of a number is called zenzizenzizenzic.
    Coined by the 16th century Welsh physician Robert Recorde, the root of
    the word is "zenzic," The German spelling of the Latin "censo," meaning
    "squared." At the time, there was no easy way to denote powers of
    numbers, so various forms of "zenzic" were used: zenzic for squared,
    zenzizenzic for the square of a square, and zenzizenzizenzic for the
    square of a square of a square.

Because of this difficulty, we have the special operation of
_exponentiation_. We can think of this as repeated multiplication. And
because multiplication is already a pretty fast way of counting,
exponentiation is even faster.

$$
xxxxxxx + xxx = x^7 + x^3
$$

$$
xxxxxxx \times xxx = x^7 \times x^3 = x^{10}
$$

From the multiplication example, we have the following rule:

> __~product rule of exponents~__. For any ${a \in \reals,}$ given ${m \in \nat}$ and
> ${n \in \nat:}$ ${a^m a^n = a^{m + n}}$

Now, consider the following:

$$
\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot a} =
\dfrac{a^4}{a^5}
$$

Really, this reduces to:

$$
\dfrac{\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot
\cancel{a}}{\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot
\cancel{a} \cdot a} = \dfrac{1}{a}
$$

The computation above provides us this rule:

> __~the quotient rule of exponents~__. For any ${a \in \reals,}$ and
> ${m \in \nat,}$ > ${n \in \nat,}$ such that ${m > n,}$ >
> ${\dfrac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m - n}}$

and this rule:

> __~the negative rule of exponents~__. For any ${a \in \reals,}$ and
> ${n \in \nat,}$ > ${a^{-n} = \dfrac{1}{a^n}}$

From the _Quotient Rule of Exponents_, we can observe:

$$
	\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a} = \dfrac{a^3}{a^3}
$$

$$
\dfrac{\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a}}{\cancel{a} \cdot
\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a}} = a^{3-3}
$$

$$
	\phantom{\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a}} = a^0
$$
$$
	\phantom{\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a}} = 1
$$

Thus, we have the rule:

> __~the zero exponent rule~__. For any ${\{a \in \reals : a \neq 0 \},}$ >
> ${a^0 = 1.}$

The _Zero Exponent Rule_ as applied to the number ${0}$ &mdash; ${0^0}$
&mdash; is a point of debate. Some mathematicians treat 0 as ${0^0 = 1.}$
In algebra and calculus, however, ${0^0 \nc \text{undefined}.}$ In
computer science, programming languages handle ${0^0}$ in numerous
different ways; some languages provide an explicit value (i.e., 1), others
undefined, others return an error.

Each approach has valid premises. If you consider ${x^y}$ as a function of
two variables, then we have a problem with the definition ${0^0 = 1.}$ If
we approach 0 along the line ${y = 0,}$ then following the definition,
${\lim\limits_{x \to 0^{+}} = 1.}$ However, if we approach 0 along the line
${x = 0,}$ then we get
${\lim\limits_{y \to 0^{y}} = \lim\limits_{y \to 0^{+}}0 = 0.}$ This would
mean ${0^0 = 0.}$ Thus, continuous mathematics generally treats
${0^0 \nc \text{undefined}.}$

On the other hand, discrete mathematics treats ${0^0 = 1.}$ In set theory,
${A^B}$ denotes the set of all functions from ${B}$ to ${A.}$ If ${A}$ and
${B}$ denote the cardinalities (i.e., the "size" of the sets) then ${A^B}$
is the size of the set of all functions from ${A}$ to ${B.}$ If we use the
value 0 for ${A}$ and ${B,}$ then 0 denotes the empty set &mdash; ${0^0}$
is the collection of all functions from the empty set to the empty set.
This is the _empty function_. There is one, and only one, empty function.
Accordingly, ${0^0 = 1.}$ Thus, it must be true that ${0^0 = 1.}$

In these materials, we will limit the _Zero Exponent Rule_ to a number
${x}$ where ${\{ x \in \reals : x \neq 0 \}.}$ Next, consider the following
example:

$$(b^3)^2$$

This expression captures:

$$(b \cdot b \cdot b ) \cdot (b \cdot b \cdot b)$$

Following the associative property of multiplication:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	(b \cdot b \cdot b ) \cdot (b \cdot b \cdot b) &= b \cdot b \cdot b \cdot b \cdot b \cdot b \\
	& = b^6
\end{aligned}
$$

Again, we have another rule:

> __~the power rule of exponents~__. For any ${a \in \reals,}$ and ${m \in \nat,}$ >
> ${n \in \nat,}$ ${(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}}$

Using the commutative and associative properties of multiplication yields
another inference:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	(ab)^3 &= (ab) \cdot (ab) \cdot (ab) ~\text{expansion} \\
	&= a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot b \cdot b \cdot b ~\text{by associativity} \\
	&= (a \cdot a \cdot a) \cdot (b \cdot b \cdot b) ~\text{by commutativity} \\
	&= a^{3}b^{3} ~\text{by the Definition of Exponent}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, it follows that:

> __~the power of a product rule of exponents~__. For all ${a, b \in \reals,}$
> given a ${n \in \nat,}$ ${(ab)^n = a^n b^n}$

This rule leads to another rule. Consider the expression
${(a^{-2}b^{2})^3.}$ Expanding and reducing this expression with the
negative rule of exponents, we get:

$$
	(a^{-2}b^{2})^3 = \left(\dfrac{b^2}{a^2}\right)^3
$$

Applyting the definition of an exponent:

$$
(a^{-2}b^{2})^3 = \left(\dfrac{b^2}{a^2}\right) \cdot
\left(\dfrac{b^2}{a^2}\right) \cdot \left(\dfrac{b^2}{a^2}\right)
$$

Then by commutativity:

$$
(a^{-2}b^{2})^3 = \dfrac{b^2 \cdot b^2 \cdot b^2}{a^2
\cdot a^2 \cdot a^2}
$$

And by the product rule of exponents:

$$
	(a^{-2}b^{2})^3 = \dfrac{b^6}{a^6}
$$

Finally, by the negative rule of exponents:

$$
\phantom{(a^{-2}b^{2})^3} = a^{-6}b^{6}
$$

This yields the rule:

> __~the power of a quotient rule of exponents~__. For all ${a, b \in \reals}$ and
> any ${n \in \uint,}$ $$\left( \dfrac{a}{b} \right)^n = \dfrac{a^n}{b^n}$$

### Perfect Powers

With exponentiation, we arrive at several special properties. First, we
have the notion of a __perfect square__. The set of all perfect square
looks something like:

${\{ 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, \ldots \}}$

Notice the pattern. These are all numbers that can be written in the form
${n^2,}$ where ${n}$ is some integer. for example, ${9}$ is a perfect
square because it can be written as ${3^2.}$ So too are ${1}$ and ${0.}$
They can be written as ${1^2}$ and ${0^2,}$ respectively. Formally:

> __definition__. A _perfect square_ is a positive integer ${n}$ such that:
> ${n = m^2 \space \space \space (m \in \uint^{+})}$

Alongside perfect squares, we have the __perfect cube__. The set of all
perfect cubes looks like:

${\{ 0, 1, 8, 27, 54, 125, 216, 343, 512 \}}$

And the formal definition:

> Definition. A _perfect cube_ is a positive integer ${n}$ such that:
> ${n = m^3 \space \space \space (m \in \uint^{+})}$

Both perfect squares and perfect cubes are examples of __perfect powers__.
In other words, we can have a "perfect tesseract"[^perfecttesseract]

[^perfecttesseract]:
    A "perfect tesseract" is not a formal term. The names "square" and
    "cube" come directly from geometry, so the next logical name would be a
    tesseract &mdash; perfect squares of squares. A more general definition
    for the perfect power:

> Definition. A positive integer ${n}$ is a _perfect power of ${x}$_ iff:
> ${n = m^x \space \space \space (m \in \uint, \space x \in \uint^{+})}$

## Radicals
By introducing the exponentiation notation, it would be very helpful to
have notation that quickly reverses the results. This notation is provided
by the radical.

### The Square Root
Suppose we have a number ${a}$ where ${a \in \reals^{+}.}$ The __square root__
of ${a}$ is the number that, when multiplied by itself, i.e., ${a^2,}$
returns ${a.}$ Now, that number may be positive or negative, because
squaring two numbers, positive or negative, yields a positive number.

> __definition__. Given ${a \in \reals^{+},}$ ${\sqrt{a}}$ is the number ${n,}$
> where ${n \in \reals}$ such that ${n^2 = a.}$

From the square root definition, we have the following rule:

> _The Product Rule of Square Roots_. Given ${a \in \R_{\geq 0}}$ and
> ${b \in \R_{\geq 0},}$ ${\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b}}$

When simplifying radical expressions, there is a useful algorithm:

1. Algorithm. Given a square root radical expression:
2. Factor perfect squares from the radicand.
3. Write the radical expression as a product of radical expressions.
4. Simplify.

For example, consider implifying the following radical expression:

$$
\sqrt{300}
$$

Factoring the perfect square:

$$
	\sqrt{100 \cdot 3}
$$

By the product rule:

$$
	\sqrt{100} \cdot \sqrt{3}
$$

Then, simplifying:

$$
	10 \sqrt{3}
$$

Here's another example. Consider this square root:

$$
	\sqrt{162 a^2 b^4}
$$

Factoring:

$$
	\sqrt{81 \cdot 2 \cdot a^4 \cdot a \cdot b^4}
$$

Then, by the product rule of square roots:

$$
	(\sqrt{81}) (\sqrt{2}) (\sqrt{a}) (\sqrt{a^4}) (\sqrt{b^4})
$$

And simplifying:

$$
	(9) (\sqrt{2}) (\sqrt{a}) (a^2) (b^2)
$$

By commutativity:

$$
	9a^2 b^2 \sqrt{2a}
$$

Another useful algorithm is combining multiple radical expressions into a
single radical expression:

1. Combine all the multiple radical expressions into a single expression.
2. Simplify.

For example, consider the radical expression: ${(\sqrt{12})(\sqrt{3}).}$ We
can multiply the this expression's terms into a single expression:

$$
	(\sqrt{12})(\sqrt{3}) = \sqrt{36}
$$

### The Quotient Rule of Square Roots

The _Quotient Rule of Square Roots_ natural results from multiplication.
First, suppose the following:

1. ${a, b \geq 0.}$
2. ${c = \sqrt{\dfrac{a}{b}}.}$
3. ${x = \sqrt{a}}$ and ${y = \sqrt{b}.}$

This implies that ${x^2 = a}$ and ${y^2 = b.}$ Next, suppose exists a
nonnegative number ${n}$ such that ${\sqrt{n^2} = n.}$ It follows that, by
substitution: $$ \left(\dfrac{x}{y}\right)^2 = \dfrac{x^2}{y^2} =
\dfrac{a}{b} $$

Hence,

$$
c = \dfrac{x}{y} = \sqrt{\dfrac{a}{b}} =
\dfrac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}
$$

by Assumptions 2 and 3. Thus, we have the following rule:

> Property. Let ${a, b \geq 0.}$ Suppose ${n = \sqrt{\dfrac{a}{b}},}$ where
> ${n \in \R_{\geq 0}.}$ Then:
> $$n = \sqrt{\dfrac{a}{b}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}$$

The rule above is particularly useful for rational expressions, which often
contain radicands. Here's a useful algorithm for handling such expressions.
Given a radical expression in the form of a quotient:

1. Write the radical quotient has the quotient of two radical expressions.
2. Simplify the numerator and denominator.

### Adding and Subtracting Square Roots

We can add or subtract radical expressions only if (1) they have the same
radicand and (2) they have the same ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ root.
For example:

$$\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2} = 4 \sqrt{2}$$

Radican expressions can often be simplified by rewriting the relevant
expression as a sum, followed by reductions.

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{18} &= \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2 \cdot 9} \\
	&= \sqrt{2} + (\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{9}) \\
	&= \sqrt{2} + 3 \sqrt{2} \\
	&= 4 \sqrt{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Here's a helpful algorithm. Given an expression that adds or subtract
radical expressions,

1. Simplify each radical expression to yield as many equal radicands as
   possible.
2. Add or subtract expressions with equal radicands.

### nth Root

The proposition ${a^3 = 8,}$ implies that ${\sqrt[3]{8} = a.}$ Thus, the
phrase "the ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ root of ${a}$" implies a number
that, when raised to the the ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ power, equals
${a.}$

If ${a}$ is a real number with at least one ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$
root, then the __principal ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ root__ of ${a}$
is the number with the same sign as ${a}$ that, when raised to the
${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ power, equals ${a.}$

> Definition. Let ${a \in \reals,}$ where ${a}$ has at least one
> ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ root.

Then the principle ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ root of ${a,}$ written as
${\sqrt[n]{a},}$ is the number with the same sign as ${a,}$ such that, when
raised to the ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ power, equals ${a.}$ We say
that ${n}$ is the __index__ of ${\sqrt[n]{a}.}$

### Rational Exponents

Rather than using a radical symbol, we can express radical expressions with
rational exponents. Needless to say, the index of such an exponent must be
a positive integer:

$$a^{\frac{1}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a}$$

A useful fact: If the index ${n}$ is even, then ${a}$ cannot be negative.

We can also have rational exponents with numerators other than 1. If the
numerator is a number other than 1, then we raise the base to a power and
take an ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ root. The numerator tells us the
power, and the denominator tells us the root:

$$a^{\frac{m}{n}} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^{m} = \sqrt[n]{a^{m}}$$

Here's a useful procedure for handling rational exponents. Given an
expression with a rational exponent:

1. Determine the power by looking at the exponent's numerator. Determine
   the root by looking at the exponent's denominator.

2. Using the base as the radicand, raise the radicand to the power and use
   the root as the index.



## Ratios
The __ratio__ of two quantities tells us the relative _sizes_ of the
quantities. For example, if we say, "There were 3 bachelors for every 5
bachelorettes," are expressing the ratio:

$$
	\dfrac{\text{bachelors}}{\text{bachelorettes}} = \dfrac{3}{5} = 3:5
$$

The use of a colon is often helpful when expressing the relative sizes of
the quantities of multiple discrete objects: The sentence, "For every 1
house on Main Street, there are 2 cats and 100 mice," may be expressed as:
${1:2:100.}$

Example: The ratio of instructors to professors at the conference is 3:4.
There are 84 total conference attendees, of which only instructors and
professors attended.

Suppose ${a}$ is the number of instructors, and ${b}$ is the number of
professors. Write an equation using the ratio information. Remember, a
ratio tells us nothing about the actual sizes of the sets. It only gives us
_relative sizes_. Thus, we know that:

$$
	\dfrac{\text{number of instructors}}{\text{number of professors}} = \dfrac{a}{b} = \dfrac{3}{4}
$$

Write an equation using the total number of conference attendees. We know
that only instructors and professors attended. Hence:

$$
	a + b = 84
$$

Question: How many professors were at the conference? We solve the system
of equations. First, isolate the ${a}$ in the first equation:

$$
	\dfrac{a}{b} = \dfrac{3}{4} \\
	a = \dfrac{3b}{4}
$$

Then, substitute:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	a + b = 84 \\
	\dfrac{3b}{4} + b = 84 \\
	\dfrac{3b + 4b}{4} = 84 \\
	\dfrac{7b}{4} = 84 \\
	7b = 331 \\
	b = 48
\end{aligned}

Example: The ratio of papayas to mangoes to rambutans in the fruit basket
is 2:3:30. Only papayas, mangoes, and rambutans comprise the fruit basket.

What is the number of mangoes to the number of fruits in the fruit basket?

From the ratio, we know that there are at least 2 papayas, 3 mangoes, and
30 rambutans. Thus, there ${2 + 3 + 30 = 35}$ total fruits. Hence:

$$
	\dfrac{m}{t} = \dfrac{3}{35}
$$

Suppose there are 385 fruits in the fruit basket. How many mangoes are
there? The ratio of mangoes to fruits is ${\dfrac{3}{35}.}$ Thus, we have:

$$
	\dfrac{3}{35} = \dfrac{t_m}{385}
$$

where ${t_m}$ is the total amount of mangoes. Solving for ${t_m}$:

$$
	\dfrac{3}{35} = \dfrac{t_m}{385} \\
	35t_m = 3 \cdot 385 \\
	t_m = \dfrac{3 \cdot 11 \cdot 35}{35}\\
	\phantom{t_m} = 33
$$

Exercise. Shylock has a jewel box filled with only emeralds and rubies. The
ratio of emeralds to the total number of jewels in the box is ${2:5.}$ If
Shylock adds 4 emeralds and removes 10 rubies, there will be twice as many
emeralds in the box as rubies. How many jewels were in the box originally?

Let ${e}$ be the number of emeralds, ${r}$ the number of rubies, and ${t}$
the total number of jewels. We know that the box consists only of emeralds
and rubies, so:

$$
	e + r = t
$$

Thus, the original ratio of emeralds to jewels can be expressed as:

$$
	\dfrac{e}{e + r} = \dfrac{2}{5}
	5e = 2(e + r)
	5e = 2e + 2r
	3e = 2r
$$

Next, we are told that if Shylock adds 4 emeralds and removes 10 rubies,
there are twice as many emeralds in the box as there are rubies. This
statement expresses a ratio:

$$
	\dfrac{e + 4}{r - 10} = \dfrac{2}{1} = 2
$$

Once more, we can express this ratio as a linear equation:

$$
	\dfrac{e + 4}{r - 10} = \dfrac{2}{1} = 2 \\
	2(r - 10) = e + 4 \\
	2r - 20 = e + 4
$$

We know ${2r = 3e,}$ so we can substitute:

$$
	3e - 20 = e + 4
	2e = 24
	e = 12
$$

Since ${e = 12,}$ we know there are
${r = \dfrac{3e}{2} = \dfrac{3(12)}{2} = \dfrac{36}{2} = 18}$ rubies. Thus,
there are ${e + r = 12 + 18 = 30}$ jewels in the box.

Exercise. 9 out of every 11 of Daniel's lawyers recommended against the
merger. The rest said recommended it. 18 of Daniel's lawyers recommended
the merger. How many lawyers does Daniel have?

Suppose ${a}$ is the number of lawyers against the merger, and ${t}$ is the
total number of lawyers. Thus, we have the following ratio:

$$
	\dfrac{a}{t} = \dfrac{9}{11}
$$

Since there are exactly 18 lawyers who recommend against the merger, there
are ${t - 18}$ lawyers who recommend the merger. Thus:

$$
	\dfrac{t - 18}{t} = \dfrac{9}{11}
$$

Now we merely must solve for ${t:}$

$$
	\dfrac{t - 18}{t} = \dfrac{9}{11} \\
	11(t - 18) = 9t \\
	11t - 198 = 9t \\
	-198 = -2t \\
	99 = t
$$

Daniel has 99 lawyers &mdash; a hefty bill.

Exercise. The ratio of correct answers to all answers is 7/10. What is the
ratio of incorrect answers to the number of correct answers?

Because there are at least 7 correct answers, the remaining 3 answers are
incorrect answers. Thus, the ratio of incorrect answers to correct answers
is 3/7.

Exercise. Nio is given a bag filled with pills. There are only red, blue,
and green pills. The ratio of red pills to blue pills to green pills is
${1:5:3.}$ There are 27 green pills in the bag. How many total pills are in
the bag?

We know there are 27 green pills. For every 3 of those pills, there is 1
red pill. Thus, there are ${27 / 3 = 9}$ red pills. Then, for every 1 red
pill, there are 5 blue pills. Thus, there are ${9 \cdot 5 = 45}$ blue
pills. The total number of pills then is:

$$
	9 + 45 + 27 = 81
$$

pills. Alternatively, we know that with just the ratio, there are
${1 + 5 + 3 = 9}$ total pills. Hence, the ratio of green pills to total
pills is ${3/9 = 1/3.}$ Suppose ${t}$ is the total number of pills in the
bag. Because there are 27 green pills total, we have:

$$
	\dfrac{27}{x} = \dfrac{1}{3} \\
	x = 27 \cdot 3 \\
	\phantom{x} = 81
$$

Exercise. Two-thirds of Thneedville's residents voted for executing
Order 66. If 634 residents did not vote for executing Order 66, how many
residents does Thneedville have?

Since 2/3 voted for, we know that 1/3 did not vote for. We know that 634
total did not vote for, so we have the ratio:

$$
	\dfrac{1}{3} = \dfrac{634}{t}
$$

where ${t}$ is the total. Solving for ${t:}$

$$
	t = 634 \cdot 3 \\
	\phantom{t} = 1902
$$

Thneedville has a total of 1,902 residents.

Exercise. Count Dracula changes height several times. The ratio of his
original height to his second height is 24:5. The ratio of his second
height to his third height is 1:12. The ratio of his original height to his
fourth height is 16:1. The tallest of these four heights is 10 meters. What
is Dracula's shortest height?

There are four heights total. We denote each with ${h_1,}$ ${h_2,}$
${h_3,}$ and ${h_4.}$ We thus have the following ratios:

$$
	\dfrac{h_1}{h_2} = \dfrac{24}{5} \\
	\dfrac{h_2}{h_3} = \dfrac{1}{12} \\
	\dfrac{h_1}{h_4} = \dfrac{16}{1}
$$

Since ${h_1 : h_2}$ is ${24 : 5,}$ we know that ${h_2 : h_1}$ is
${5 : 24.}$ This means that ${h_2}$ is ${5/24}$ of ${h_1.}$

$$
	h_2 = \dfrac{5}{24}h_1
$$

Then, since ${h_2:h_3}$ is ${1:12,}$ we know that ${h_3}$ is 12 times the
second height:

$$
	h_3 = 12h_2 = 12 \left( \dfrac{5}{24} \right)
$$

Since ${h_1 : h_4 = 16:1,}$ the original height is 16 times the fourth
height. Thus,

$$
	h_4 = \dfrac{x}{16}
$$

From the analysis thus far, we have:

$$
	h_1 \\
	h_2 = \dfrac{5h_1}{24} \\
	h_3 = \dfrac{5h_1}{2} \\
	h_4 = \dfrac{h_1}{16}
$$

Of these values, ${h_3}$ is the largest, since its constant multiplier is
${5/2.}$ Hence, we solve for ${x}$ with 10:

$$
	\dfrac{5x}{2} = 10 \\
	5x = 20 \\
	x = 20/5 \\
	x = 4
$$

The shortest height is ${h_4,}$ since its constant multiplier is ${1/16.}$
Evaluating:

$$
	h_4 = \dfrac{4}{16} = 0.25
$$

Hence, Count Dracula's shortest height is ${0.25}$ meters.

Exercise. What is the ratio of ${x}$ to ${y}$ if:

$$
	\dfrac{10x - 3y}{13x - 2y} = \dfrac{3}{5}
$$

The objective is rewrite the equation to express a relation of
${\dfrac{x}{y}.}$ The key is cross multiplication:

$$
	\dfrac{10x - 3y}{13x - 2y} = \dfrac{3}{5} \\
	5(10x - 3y) = 3(13x - 2y) \\
	50x - 15y = 39x - 6y \\
	11x = 9y \\
	\dfrac{x}{y} = \dfrac{9}{11}
$$

Exercise. If ${x/y = 2/3}$ and ${y/z = 7/5,}$ then what is ${z/x?}$

### Percentages

The word __percent__ is likely an abbreviation for the pseudo-Latin _per
centum_, meaning "per hundred." Denoted by the ${\%,}$ a percent is a
shorthand for ${n/100,}$ where ${n}$ ${n \in \reals.}$ Thus,
${1/4 = 25/100 = 25\%.}$

Exercise. What percent of 240 is 48?

We solve for ${x}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
		240 (x/100) &= 48 \\
		x/100 &= 48/240 \\
		x &= 100(48/240) \\
		&= 4800/240 \\
		&= 480/24 \\
		&= 20
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, ${48}$ is ${20\%}$ of ${240.}$ Of course, we could have found the
percentage with simple arithmetic: ${48/240 = 0.2.}$ Then, multiplying
${0.2}$ by ${100,}$ we get ${20\%.}$ We used algebra first because it
provides the appropriate approach for handling more complex percentage
problems.

Exercise. 36 is ${120\%}$ of what number?

We solve for ${x:}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
	x(120/100) &= 36 \\
	x(12/10) &= 36 \\
	\dfrac{12x}{10} &= 36 \\
	12x &= 360 \\
	x &= 360/12 \\
	&= 30
\end{aligned}
$$

When we increase a number ${x}$ by some percentage, we add the percent of
${x}$ to ${x}$ itself. For example, if we increase 100 by ${1\%}$, we
increase 100 by 1, since ${1\%}$ of 100 is 1 &mdash; 101. Likewise, if we
increase 100 by ${100\%,}$ we obtain 200, since ${100\%}$ of 100 is 100
${(100 + 100 = 200.)}$

### Proportions

Suppose there is a ratio of two variable quantities. If this ratio is
always the same, we say the two quantities are in __direct proportion__.
For example, suppose ${x = 5}$ and ${y = 9.}$ Now suppose that ${x}$ and
${y}$ are directly proportional. What is ${y}$ when ${x = 14?}$ Since ${x}$
and ${y}$ are directly proportional:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\dfrac{x}{y} &= \dfrac{5}{9} \\
	\dfrac{5}{9} &= \dfrac{14}{y} \\
	9(14) &= 5y \\
	126 &= 5y \\
	y &= 126/5 = 25.2 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Another example: Suppose ${a}$ and ${b^2}$ are directly proportional,
${a = 5,}$ and ${b = 9.}$ What is ${a}$ when ${b = 12?}$ Since ${a}$ and
${b^2}$ are directly proportional:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\dfrac{a}{b^2} &= \dfrac{5}{(9)^2} \\
	&= \dfrac{5}{81} \\
	\dfrac{5}{81} &= \dfrac{a}{(12)^2} \\
	81a &= 5(12)(12) \\
	(3)(3)(3)(3) a &= 5(3)(4)(3)(4) \\
	\cancel{(3)}\cancel{(3)}(3)(3) a &= 5\cancel{(3)}(4)\cancel{(3)}(4) \\
	9a &= 80 \\
	a &= 80/9
\end{aligned}
$$

### Rational Expressions

The quotient of two polynomial expressions is called a _rational
expression_. When handling rational expressions, we use the same rules
applicable to fractions.

#### Simplifying Rational Expressions

Simplifying a rational expressions is no different from simplifying a
fraction. The only differences is that we must often use the techniques of
factorization, as well as be mindful of the laws governing variable
manipulation. To simplify a rational expression:

1. Factor the numerator and denominator;
2. cancel any common factors

For example:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\dfrac{x^2 - 9}{x^2 + 4x + 3} &= \dfrac{(x+3)(x-3)}{(x+3)(x+1)} \\
	&= \dfrac{\cancel{(x+3)}(x-3)}{\cancel{(x+3)}(x+1)}
	&= \dfrac{(x-3)}{(x+1)}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Multiplying Rational Expressions

We follow the same procedures for multiplying fractions when we multiply
rational expressions: To multiply two rational expressions:

1. Factor the numerator and denominator;
2. multiply the numerators;
3. multiply the denominators
4. simplify.

For example, given:

$$
	\left(\dfrac{x^2 + 4x - 5}{3x + 18}\right)\left(\dfrac{2x-1}{x+5}\right)
$$

By factorization:

$$
	\left(\dfrac{x^2 + 4x - 5}{3x + 18}\right)\left(\dfrac{2x-1}{x+5}\right) = \left(\dfrac{(x+5)(x-1)}{3(x+6)}\right)\left(\dfrac{2x-1}{x+5}\right)
$$

Using the associative property of multiplication:

$$
	\left(\dfrac{x^2 + 4x - 5}{3x + 18}\right)\left(\dfrac{2x-1}{x+5}\right) = \dfrac{(x+5)(x-1)(2x-1)}{3(x+6)(x+5)}
$$

Cancelling like terms:

$$
	\left(\dfrac{x^2 + 4x - 5}{3x + 18}\right)\left(\dfrac{2x-1}{x+5}\right) = \dfrac{\cancel{(x+5)}(x-1)(2x-1)}{3(x+6)\cancel{(x+5)}}
$$

We can thus conclude:

$$
	\left(\dfrac{x^2 + 4x - 5}{3x + 18}\right)\left(\dfrac{2x-1}{x+5}\right) = \dfrac{(x-1)(2x-1)}{3(x+6)}
$$

#### Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions

Once more, adding and subtracting rational expressions works the same way
was adding and subtracting fractions: We may add and subtract the fractions
iff the rational expressions have a common denominator. To ease the
computation, the _least common denominator_ &mdash; the smallest multiple
that the denominators have in common &mdash; should be used whenever
possible.

To add or subtract rational expressions:

1. Factor the numerator and denominator.
2. Find the least common denominator of the expressions &mdash; to find the
   least common denominator:
   1. Factor the expressions.
   2. Multiply all of the distinct factors.
3. Multiply the expressions by a form of 1 that changes the denominators to
   the LCD.
4. Add or subtract the numerators. Simplify.

For example, given:

$$
	\dfrac{5}{x} + \dfrac{6}{y}
$$

The least common denominator is ${(x)(y).}$ Multiplying the expressions by
a form of 1 to ensure the denominator is the least common denominator:

$$
	\left(\dfrac{5}{x} \cdot \dfrac{y}{y}\right) + \left(\dfrac{6}{y} \cdot \dfrac{x}{x} \right)
$$

Carrying out the multiplication:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\left(\dfrac{5}{x} \cdot \dfrac{y}{y}\right) + \left(\dfrac{6}{y} \cdot \dfrac{x}{x} \right) &= \dfrac{5y}{xy} + \dfrac{6x}{xy} \\
	&= \dfrac{5y + 6x}{xy}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Simplifying Nested Rational Expressions

Often, the numerators and denominators of a rational expression will
themselves contain rational expressions. They might look like:

$$
	\dfrac{a + \dfrac{b}{c}}{\dfrac{d}{e} + \dfrac{f}{g}}
$$

We call such expressions _nested rational expressions_ (the rational
expressions in the numerators and denominators are colloquially called
_nesting rats_). Nested rational expressions often strike fear in students,
partly because of their size, partly because they are not often
encountered. Nested rational expressions, however, are a good example of
where _Polish notation_ has an advantage over the more common _infix
notation_ (the notation above). The same expression above can be expressed
as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	(/ \space &[+ \space a \space (/ \space b \space c)] \\[1em] &[+ \space (/ \space d \space e) (/ \space f \space g)])
\end{aligned}
$$

When encountering deeply nested rational expressions like the above,
consider rewriting the expression in Polish notation and simplifying the
expression from inside to outside. For most nested rational expressions,
however, we use the following algorithm:

1. Combine the expressions in the numerator into a single rational
   expression by adding or subtracting.
2. Combine the expressions in the denominator into a single rational
   expression by adding or subtracting.
3. Rewrite the overall expression as the numerator divided by the
   numerator.
4. Rewrite the overall expression as a multplication.
5. Multiply.
6. Simplify.

For example, 

$$
	\dfrac{y + \dfrac{1}{x}}{\dfrac{x}{y}}.
$$

Combine the expressions in the numerator into a single expression:

$$
	\dfrac{\dfrac{yx}{x} + \dfrac{1}{x}}{\dfrac{x}{y}} = \dfrac{\dfrac{yx + 1}{x}}{\dfrac{x}{y}}.
$$

Rewrite the expression as multiplication:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\dfrac{\dfrac{yx}{x} + \dfrac{1}{x}}{\dfrac{x}{y}} &= \dfrac{yx + 1}{x} \cdot \dfrac{y}{x} \\
	&= \dfrac{y(xy + 1)}{x^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Rationalizing Radical Denominators

Rational expressions can contain radicals in the denominator. These can be
cumbersome to handle, and it is almost always best to simplify them.

To remove radicals from the denominators of rational expressions, we
multiply the radical expression by the form of 1 that will eliminate the
radical. If the denominator contains a single term, we multiply the
rational expression by its reciprocal. I.e., if the rational-radical
expression is ${\dfrac{1}{b \sqrt{c}},}$ we multiply the expression by
${\dfrac{\sqrt{c}}{\sqrt{c}}.}$

Now, if the denominator of the rational-radical expression contains the sum
of a rational and an irrational term, we multiply the numerator and the
denominator by the conjugate of the denominator &mdash; the expression
wherein the sign of the radial portion of the denominator is made opposite.
For example, if the denominator is ${a + b \sqrt{c},}$ then the conjuage is
${a - b \sqrt{c}.}$

Given a radical expression of the form ${\dfrac{a}{\sqrt{b}},}$

1. Multiply the numerator and the denominator by the radical in the
   denominator.
2. Simplify.


## Division

Of the core arithmetic operators, division is the most complex. In any
discussion of division, we must first begin with two subsets of integers,
the __even integers__:

$$
    \{ 2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots \}
$$

and the odd integers:

$$
    \{1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots\}
$$

Notice that both the even integers and the odd integers increment by 2. The
difference, however, is that the even integers start at 2, and the odd
integers start at 1. A number's property of odd-ness or even-ness is called
the number's __parity__. Note that parity is a property held only by the
positive integers. The negative integers are neither even nor odd. We can
abstract this idea with algebra: An even integer is an integer that can be
written as ${2k,}$ where ${k}$ is a positive integer. Denoting the set of
even integers with the symbol ${\Z_{\text{even}},}$ and the set of positive
integers with the symbol ${\Z_{\text{odd}},}$ we can define an even integer
more formally as:

> Definition. Let ${x \in \uint.}$ >
> ${x \in \Z_{\text{even}} \iff x = 2k : k \in \uint^{+}}$ I.e., an integer
> ${x}$ is even if, and only if, it can be written in the form ${2k,}$
> where ${k}$ is a positive integer.

For the odd integers, we write:

> Definition. Let ${x \in \uint.}$ >
> ${x \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \iff x = 2k - 1 : k \in \uint^{+}}$

I.e., an integer ${x}$ is odd if, and only if, it can be written in the
form ${2k - 1,}$ where ${k}$ is a positive integer. Alternatively, we can
define odd integers as the following:

> Definition. Let ${x \in \uint.}$ >
> ${x \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \iff x = 2k + 1 : k \in \nat}$

In other words, an integer ${x}$ is odd if, and only if, it can be written
in the form ${2k + 1,}$ where ${k}$ is a natural number.

The only meaningful difference between the first and second definition is
whether ${k}$ is a natural number or a positive integer. In other words,
whether ${k}$ can be 0. If ${k}$ can be 0, then we must change the
definition from ${2k - 1}$ to ${2k + 1,}$ because if ${k = 0,}$ then
${2k - 1 = -1.}$ ${-1}$ is neither odd nor even, because parity is a
property that applies only to positive integers (0 is also neither odd nor
even).

Knowing the parity of two integers allows us to quickly determine the
parity of their sums:

> __lemma__. Let ${a, b \in \uint^{+}.}$ Then:
>
> 1. ${a, b \in \Z_{\text{even}} \nc a + b \in \Z_{\text{even}}}$
> 2. ${[(a \in \Z_{\text{even}}) \land (b \in \Z_{\text{odd}})] \nc a - b \in \uint\_{\text{odd}}}$
> 3. ${[(a \in \Z_{\text{odd}}) \land (b \in \Z_{\text{even}})] \nc a - b \in \uint\_{\text{odd}}}$
> 4. ${[(a \in \Z_{\text{odd}}) \land (b \in \Z_{\text{odd}})] \nc a + b \in \Z_{\text{even}}}$

That is, the sum of two even integers is an even integer; the sum of an odd
integer and an even integer is an odd integer; and the sum of two odd
integers is an even integer. From the rule of addition by 0, we also have
the following propositions:

> __lemma__. Let ${a \in \uint^{+}.}$ Then:
> ${a \in \Z_{\text{even}} \nc a + 0 \in \Z_{\text{even}}}$ >
> ${a \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \nc a + 0 \in \Z_{\text{odd}}}$

Let's prove the first property. First, the hypothesis to be proved:

    Let ${a, b \in \uint^{+}.}$ If ${a \in \Z_{\text{even}}}$ and ${b \in \Z_{\text{even},}}$ then ${a + b \in \Z_{\text{even}}.}$

Because ${a}$ and ${b}$ are even integers, then by definition, ${a}$ and
${b}$ can be written in the forms:

$$
    a = 2n, ~ b = 2m
$$

where ${n, m \in \uint^{+}}$. Thus, by substitution, the expression ${a + b}$
can be written as:

$$
    a + b = 2n + 2m
$$

By distributivity:

$$
    a + b = 2(n + m)
$$

The sum of two positive integers is a positive integer. Accordingly, the
sum of ${n}$ and ${m}$ is some positive integer ${k.}$ As such, the
expression ${2(n + m)}$ can be written as:

$$
    a + b = 2k
$$

Because ${a + b}$ is an expression of the form ${2k,}$ then by definition,
${a + b}$ is even.

Now let's prove the second. Again, we'll use a direct proof. First, the
hypothesis to proved:

> Let ${a,b \in \uint^{+}.}$ If ${a}$ is even and ${b}$ is odd, then ${a + b}$
> is odd.

Suppose ${a}$ is even and ${b}$ is odd. Then by definition, ${a}$ and ${b}$
are positive integers of the form:

$$
    a = 2n, b = 2m + 1
$$

where ${n}$ is a positive integer, and ${m}$ is a natural number. It
follows that:

$$
    a + b = 2n + 2m + 1
$$

Then, by commutativity:

$$
    a + b = (2n + 2m) + 1
$$

And by associativity:

$$
    a + b = 2(n + m) + 1
$$

Given that ${n}$ is a positive integer and ${m}$ is a non-negative integer
(since ${m}$ is a natural number), ${n + m}$ is a natural number.
Accordingly:

$$
    a + b = 2k + 1
$$

where ${k = n + m,}$ which is some natural number. Hence, ${a + b}$ must be
odd, by definition.

Parity provides yet another proposition:

> Lemma. Let ${a \in \uint^{+}.}$ Then
>
> 1. ${a \in \Z_{\text{even}} \nc a^2 \in \Z_{\text{even}}}$
> 2. ${a \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \nc a^2 \in \Z_{\text{odd}}}$

The proposition above tells us that the square of an even integer is even,
and the square of an odd integer is odd. Let's prove it.

The method here is by direct proof. There are two hypotheses to be proved:

1. If ${a}$ is even, then ${a^2}$ is even.
2. If ${a}$ is odd, then ${a^2}$ is odd.

We prove each hypothesis in turn, beginning with the first.

Suppose ${a \in \Z_{\text{even}}.}$ Since ${a}$ is an even integer, then by
definition, ${a}$ is a positive integer of the form ${2n,}$ where ${n}$ is
a positive integer. By substitution:

$$
    a^2 = (2n)^2
$$

Applying the definition of an exponent:

$$
    a^2 = (2n)(2n)
$$

By the associative property of multiplication, we get:

$$
    a^2 = (2)(2 \cdot n \cdot n)
$$

And by the definition of an exponent:

$$
    a^2 = (2)(2n^2)
$$

Because the product of positive integer is a positive integer, the intger
${2n^2}$ is a positive integer. Hence:

$$
    a^2 = 2m
$$

where ${m}$ is a positive integer. Because ${2m}$ is an even integer by
definition, ${a^2}$ is even.

Next, we consider the second hypothesis. Suppose ${a \in
\Z_{\text{odd}}.}$
Given that ${a}$ is an odd integer, then by definition, ${a}$ is a positive
integer of the form ${2n + 1,}$ where ${n}$ is a positive integer. By
substitution:

$$
    a^2 = (2n + 1)^2
$$

By expansion:

$$
    a^2 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1
$$

By associativity:

$$
    a^2 = (4n^2 + 4n) + 1
$$

By distributivity:

$$
    a^2 = 2(2n^2 + 2n) + 1
$$

Because ${n}$ is a positive integer, $$2n^2 + 2n$$ is a positive integer.
Hence:

$$
    a^2 = 2k + 1
$$

where ${k}$ is a positive integer. Because ${2k + 1}$ is an odd integer by
definition, ${a^2}$ is odd. The proposition we've just proven yields a
corollary:

> Corollary. Let ${a \in \uint^{+}.}$ Then:
>
> 1. ${a^2 \in \Z_{\text{even}} \nc a \in \Z_{\text{even}}}$
> 2. ${a^2 \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \nc a \in \Z_{\text{odd}}}$

As with many corollaries, the propositions above are implied by the
previous theorem. If ${a^2}$ is even, then ${a}$ must be even, for if ${a}$
is odd, then ${a^2}$ is odd. Similarly, if ${a^2}$ is odd, then ${a}$ must
be odd, for if ${a}$ is even, then ${a^2}$ is even. This is a
straightforward example of logical contradiction.

### Divisibility

It is from parity that we generalize the concept of __divisibility__.
Suppose ${a}$ is a positive integer and ${b}$ is an integer. When we say
that ${b}$ is divisible by ${a,}$ we mean that ${a}$ divides ${b.}$ We
denote this proposition with the notation ${a \space\vert\space b.}$ An
integer ${b}$ is divisible by ${a}$ if, and only if, ${b = an,}$ where
${n}$ is some integer.

> Definition. Let ${a \in \uint^{+}}$ and ${b \in \uint.}$ Then:
>
> $$
> a \space\vert\space b \iff b = an
> $$
>
> where ${n \in \uint.}$

The definition above yields several useful propositions:

> _Proposition_. Every integer is divisible by 1. Every positive integer is
> divisible by itself.

The first proposition is implied by the fact that every integer can be
written as ${n = (1)(n).}$ This in turn implies the second proposition.

### Composites & Primes
From the definition above, there are two subsets within the natural
numbers. Any natural number that can be grouped into a solid rectangle is
called a __composite number__ (also called _compound numbers_). More
formally:

> __definition__. A _composite number_ ${k}$ is a natural number greater than
> 1, divisible by some positive integer ${n,}$ where ${n \neq 1.}$

The negation of this definition yields the __prime numbers__, numbers that
cannot be grouped into a solid rectangle.

> __definition__. A _prime number_ ${m}$ is a natural number greater than 1,
> divisible only by 1 and itself.

Note that from the definitions above, we see that the numbers 0 and 1 have
a special property: Both 0 and 1 are neither prime nor compound.

### Division & Rational Numbers

The operation of division is closely tied to the __rational numbers__. A
rational number is any number that can be written in the form:

$$ \dfrac{m}{n} \text{or} m/n $$

where ${m}$ and ${n}$ are integers, and ${n \neq 0.}$ The last condition is
crucial, because in this particular world (classical algebra), we cannot
divide by 0. The rational numbers come in various forms:
${\ldots, \dfrac{1}{3}, - \dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{2}{3}, 1.4, 0.08, 12.0, 0.0, \ldots}$

The rule is, as long as a number can be written as ${m/n,}$ where ${m, n}$
are integers and ${n \neq 0,}$ then the number is rational
number.[^rationalnumberscs]

[^rationalnumberscs]:
    In computer science, the rational numbers are called __floats__ or
    __floating point numbers__ (the decimal point "floats" as needed).

Otherwise, the number is an irrational number. Note what this definition
means. Every integer satisfies the definition rational number definition,
so we say that the rational numbers are a proper superset of the integers.
In other words, every integer is a rational number, but not every rational
number is an integer.

### The Division Algorithm

Question: A six-digit number having 1 as its leftmost digit becomes three
times bigger if we take this digit off and put it at the end of the number.
What is this number?

Let the number be $1ABCDE$. Then, $ABCDE1 = 3 \times 1ABCDE$. Rewrite this
with the multiplication algorithm:

$$
\begin{array}{cc} & A & B & C & D & E \\ \times & & & & & 3 \\ \hline A & B
& C & D & E & 1 \end{array}
$$

Let's focus on $E$. We need a digit $E$ where $3 \times E = n1$, where $n$
is a digit. This digit must be 7, for $7 \times 3 = 21$. We know that $E$
is 7, so what might $D$ be? Well, we need a digit $D$ where
$(D \times 3) + 2 = 7$. Or, rearranging, $D \times 3 = 5$. The only digit
that would satisfy this condition is $D = 5$ (since $3 \times 5 + 2
= 17$.

We know that $D$ is 5, so now we look at $C$. We need a digit $C$ such that
$(C \times 3) + 1 = 5$, or, rearranging, $C \times 3 = 4$. There is only
one digit that satisfies this condition, 8. Thus, $C = 8$.

Now we look at $B$. What digit satisfies the condition $B \times 3 = 6$? It
must be 2. Therefore, $B = 2$.

Finally, we look at $A$. What digit results in $A \times 3 = 12$. It must
be 4, since $3 \times 4 = 12$. Hence, the digits are $A = 4$, $B = 2$,
$C = 8$, and $D = 5$.

Question: Divide 123123123 by 123. Again, we use the division algorithm:

$$
\begin{array}{r} 1001001 \\ 123{\overline{\smash{\big)}\,123123123}} \\ - 123 \phantom{123123} \\ \hline 0 123 \phantom{123} \\ - 123 \phantom{123} \\ \hline 0 123 \\ - 123 \\ \hline 0 \end{array}
$$

We can confirm the result with the multiplication algorithm:

$$
\begin{array}{cc} \begin{align*} 1001001 \\ \times \phantom{1001} 123
\\ \hline \phantom{00} 3 003 003 \\ \phantom{00} 2 002 002 \phantom{1} \\
+ \phantom{00} 1 001 001 \phantom{12} \\ \hline 123123123 \end{align*}
\end{array}
$$

Question: Can one predict the remainder when ${111
\ldots 1}$ (100 ones) is
divided by ${11 11 11 1}$?

$11 11 11 1$ is 7 ones. Consider a simpler case:

$$
\begin{array}{r} 10 \\ 11 {\overline{\smash{\big)}\, 111}} \\ -11
\phantom{0} \\ \hline \phantom{0} 01 \\ - \phantom{00} 0 \\ \hline
\phantom{000} 1 \end{array}
$$

Question: Divide $1000 \ldots 0$ (20 zeros) by 7.

Consider a simpler case:

$$
\begin{array}{r} 14 \\ 7 {\overline{\smash{\big)}\, 100}} \\ - 7
\phantom{0} \\ \hline 30 \\ - 28 \\ \hline 4 \end{array}
$$

Let's keep adding 0s to see if there's a pattern:

$$
\begin{array}{r} 142857 \\ 7 {\overline{\smash{\big)}\, 1 000 000}} \\
- 7 \phantom{000 00} \\ \hline 30 \phantom{000 0} \\ -28 \phantom{000 0}
\\ \hline 20 \phantom{000} \\ - 14 \phantom{000} \\ \hline 60 \phantom{00}
\\ - 56 \phantom{00} \\ \hline 40 \phantom{0} \\ - 35 \phantom{0} \\
\hline 50 \\ - 49 \\ \hline 1 \end{array}
$$

We return to a remainder of 1. This tells us that if we add another 0,
we're back at 10, which gives us 30, then 20, then 60, then 40, and so on.

This also tells us that after every six 0s, we return to 10. Thus, for
twenty 0s, we make 3 "laps" of returning to 10, with two more "runs":

- Lap 1 (six 0s): 142857 remainder 1
- Lap 2 (twelve 0s): 142857 14285 remainder 7
- Lap 3 (eighteen 0s): 142857 142857 remainder 1
- Lap 4 (nineteen 0s): 142857 142857 1 remainder 4
- Lap 5 (twenty 0s): 142857 142857 14 remainder 2

Hence, the quotient is: 14,285,714,285,714 + 2.

## Absolute Value
Given a real number ${x,}$ be a real number, the _absolute value_ of $x$ is the distance between $x$ and the origin. We denote the absolute value of $x$ with the notation: $\lvert x \rvert$ For example, the numbers -8 and 8 are both 8 units from the origin. Thus, $\lvert 8 \rvert = 8$ and $\lvert -8 \rvert = 8$. We define the absolute value as follows:

> __~absolute value~.__ Given ${x \in \reals,}$
>
> $$
>	 \lvert x \rvert = \begin{cases} x &\text{ if } x \geq 0 \\ -x &\text{ if } x < 0 \end{cases}
> $$

For example, $\lvert -8 \rvert = -(-8) = 8$. From the definition of absolute value, we can make the following inferences:

| ${\forall x \in \reals}$                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\lvert x \rvert \geq 0$                                                  |
| $x \leq \lvert x \rvert$ and $-x \leq \lvert x \rvert$                    |
| ${\lvert x \rvert}^2 = x^2$                                               |
| $\sqrt{x^2} = \lvert x \rvert$                                            |
| $\lvert ab \rvert = \lvert a \rvert \cdot \lvert b \rvert$                |
| $\lvert \dfrac{a}{b} \rvert = \dfrac{\lvert a \rvert }{\lvert b \rvert }$ |
| $\lvert a + b \rvert \leq \lvert a \rvert + \lvert b \rvert $             |

### Removing Absolute Value Symbols
When we encounter expressions containing absolute values, it's often a good idea to rewrite the expression without the absolute value symbols. For example, consider the expression $\lvert -2 - x^2 \rvert$. Using our algebraic definition above, we can rewrite this expression:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\lvert -2 - x^2 \rvert &= -(-2 - x^2) \\
	&= 2 + x^2
\end{aligned}
$$

The example above reveals useful insight. Suppose that real numbers are points along the real number line. Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers. Because $a$ and $b$ are points along a line, the distance between $a$ and $b$ is $a - b$. And since the absolute value of a number is only concerned with the distance between a point and the origin, we can infer:

> For real numbers $a$ and $b$, the distance between $a$ and $b$ is, ${\lvert a - b \rvert = \lvert b - a \rvert.}$

### Absolute Values and Inequalities
Whenever we see absolute values in inequalities, we should be on high alert. Suppose that ${a \in \mathbb{R},}$ ${u \in \mathbb{R},}$ and ${a > 0.}$ The following rules hold:

> ${\lvert u \rvert < a \iff -a < u < a}$
> ${\lvert u \rvert < a \iff (u < -a \text{ or } u > a) }$

These rules follow from observing the number line. The statement ${-a < u < a}$ implies that $u$ is somewhere between $-a$ and $a$, which is equivalent to saying that the distance from $u$ to 0 is less than $a$ (which, in mathematical notation, is simply ${\lvert u \rvert < a }$).

When inequalities contain expressions couched between absolute value symbols,
the inequality is effectively expressing the expression's distance from 0. For
example, suppse ${\lvert x - 3 \rvert < 1. }$ This statement tells us that the
distance of ${\lvert x - 3 \rvert }$ from 0 is less than 1. Because absolute
values tell us the distance from 0, the statement ${\lvert x - 3 \rvert < 1,}$
allows us to infer:

$$
	-1 < x - 3 < 1
$$

## Logarithms

Consider the number 16. How many times can we divide 16 by 2? Let's try it:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	16 / 2 &= 8 \\
	8 / 2 &= 4 \\
	4 / 2 &= 2 \\
	2 / 2 &= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Above, we can see that we can divide the number 16 by 2 a total of 4 times.
This corresponds to:

$$
\begin{aligned} 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 &= 2^4 \\ &= 16 \end{aligned}
$$

The answer to "How many times can we divide a number ${n}$ by this constant
${x?}$" is the __logarithm__. More formally:

> __definition__. Given ${b = a^x,}$ ${a \neq 1,}$ ${a > 0,}$ and
> ${b > 0,}$ > ${a^x = b \iff x = \log_{a}b}$

We say that ${x}$ is the logarithm in base ${a}$ of ${b.}$ The logarithm
provides a way of deducing, and rewriting, the exponent of a number. For
example:

- ${2^3 = 8 \iff \log_{2}8 = 3}$
- ${5^2 = 25 \iff \log_{5}25 = 2}$
- ${10^3 = 1000 \iff \log_{10}1000 = 3}$

Suppose that ${y = a^x.}$ From the definition above, it follows that
${a =
\log_{a}y.}$ Then, it follows then that ${x = \log_{a}a^x}$ by
substitution. We state this as a corollary:

> _Corollary_. ${x = \log_{a}a^x}$

If ${x = a^y,}$ then again from the definition, ${y = \log_{a}x.}$ It
follows that ${x = a^{\log_{a}x},}$ provided that ${x > 0.}$ We again state
this as a corollary:

> _Corollary_. ${x = a^{\log_{a}x},}$ where ${x > 0}$

The definition and corollaries above directly lead to the **laws of
logarithms**:

> _Log Laws_. Where ${A, B \in \nat,}$ ${c > 0,}$ and ${c \neq 1,}$
>
> $$
> \begin{aligned} \log_{c}A + \log_{c}B &= \log_{c}(AB) \\[1em]
> \log_{c}A - \log_{c}B &= \log_{c}\left(\dfrac{A}{B}\right) \\[1em] n
> \log_{c}A &= \log_{c}(A^n) \end{aligned}
> $$

## The Binomial Theorem

Recall that a binomial is a polynomial consisting of the sum of two
monomials. In other words, a polynomial with two terms. For example, the
expression:

$$
	ax^m - bx^n
$$

is a binomial, where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are numbers, ${m}$ and ${n}$ are
distinct, nonnegative integers, and ${x}$ is a variable (or more formally,
the indeterminate). Taking higher powers of binomials and expanding them is
a process that quickly grows tedious. To see how, let's consider a few
examples.

First, let's expand ${(a + b)^0.}$ This is straightforward; it's just
${1:}$

$$
	(a + b)^0 = 1
$$

Similarly, ${(a + b)^1}$ isn't so bad either:

$$
	(a + b)^1 = a + b
$$

$(a + b)^2$ isn't terrible if we know our expansions by heart:

$$
	(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
$$

How about ${(a + b)^3}$? Well, we can carry it out:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		(a + b)^3 &= (a + b)(a + b)(a + b) \\ &= (a + b)(a^2 +
		2ab + b^2) \\ &= a^3 + 2a^2b + ab^2 + a^2b + 2ab^2 + b^3 \\ &= a^3 + 3a^2b +
		3ab^2 + b^3
	\end{aligned}
$$

And ${(a + b)^4:}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
	(a + b)^4 &= (a + b)(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3) \\ &= a(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3) + b(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3)\\ &= a^4 + 3a^3b
	+ 3a^2b^2 + ab^3 + a^3b + 3a^2b^2 + 3ab^3 + b^4 \\ &= a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice how these expressions are getting more and more tedious. Laying out
the expansions in a table:

| expression    | expansion                                           | term count |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| ${(a + b)^0}$ | 1                                                   | 1          |
| ${(a + b)^1}$ | ${a + b}$                                           | 2          |
| ${(a + b)^2}$ | ${a^2 + 2ab + b^2}$                                 | 3          |
| ${(a + b)^3}$ | ${a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3}$                       | 4          |
| ${(a + b)^4}$ | ${a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4}$             | 5          |
| ${(a + b)^5}$ | ${a^5 + 5a^4b + 10a^3b^2 + 10a^2b^3 + 5ab^4 + b^5}$ | 6          |

Needless to say, expanding binomials with higher powers by hand is tedious
and prone to error. Attempting to expand something like ${(a + b)^{100}}$
would take a very, very long time. And then after we're done, we must still
go through the process of checking if our algebraic manipulation is
correct.

Fortunately, there's a theorem to make our lives easier. But, before we
examine this theorem, let's segue briefly into the world of counting.

## Solving Quadratic Equations

There are four primary ways of finding the truth set of quadratic
equations:

1. using the square root method;
2. factoring;
3. completing the square; and
4. using the quadratic equation

The next few sections explore how each of these methods are used.

### Completing the Square

Given the quadratic equation ${x^2 + Ax = B}$ ompleting the square can be
summarized into a simple algorithm:

1. Look at the cofficient of ${x.}$
2. $A$ Divide the coefficient by 2: ${\dfrac{A}{2}.}$
3. Square the result: ${\left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2}$
4. Add the number from step 1 to both sides of the equation:
   $$
   	x^2 - Ax + \left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2 = B + \left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2
   $$
5. Simplify the equation.
6. Factor the result Solve for $x.$

For example, suppose we were confronted by the quadratic equation:

$$
	x^2 - 2x = 4.
$$

Applying the method of completing the square, we look at the coefficient of
$x$ first. We see that it's -2. We divide this number by 2 and square it:

$$
	\left(\dfrac{(-2)}{2}\right)^2 = 1.
$$

Then we add this number to both sides of the equation:

$$
	x^2 - 2x + 1 = 4 + 1.
$$

Simplifying, we obtain:

$$
	x^2 - 2x + 1 = 5
$$

We factor the left-hand side, and reach

$$
	(x-1)(x-1) = 5.
$$

Or, with a square,

$$
	(x-1)^2 = 5.
$$

Taking the square root of both sides, we have

$$
	x - 1 = \pm \sqrt{5}.
$$

(always be mindful of the the fact that squares result from both positive
and negative numbers). Finally, we solve for ${x}$ by adding 1 to both
sides:

$$x = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}.$$

Thus, the truth set of the equation ${x^2 - 2x = 4}$ is
${x \in \{ 1 + \sqrt{5}, 1 - \sqrt{5} \}.}$

### Why Does Completing the Square Work?

The method of completing the square follows from geometry. Suppose we had a
square, ${\square ABCD}$ with sides of length ${x}$:

We know that the area of ${\square ABCD}$ is ${x^2.}$ Now suppose that we
were to add a rectangle with a width of $b$ and a length of $x$ to the
square. This rectangle has an area of ${bx}$. When we add the rectangle, we
obtain a total area of ${x^2 + bx:}$

Now suppose we rearranged the resulting shape by (1) splitting the added
rectangle vertically, (2) leaving one half at the original square's side,
and (3) moving the other half to the square's base:

Notice that a gap is left. What might be the dimensions of the shape that
would fill that gap? Well, we know that the total area of the rectange we
created earlier is ${x^2 + bx}$. We also know that the two halves we
created must respectively have an area of ${x\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right).}$
Thus, the shape we need to fill the gap must have an area of
${\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)^2}$, or, simplifying the expression,
${\dfrac{b^2}{4}.}$

To see the connection to the algebraic method, consider the shape above
without filling the gap. That shape has an area of
${x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)x + \left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)x = x^2 + bx.}$
When we complete the square, we add the area of the "missing square":
${\dfrac{b^2}{4}.}$ Look familiar? Algebraically, the area of the
incomplete shape is a quadratic equation.

If we had an equation of the form ${ax^2 + bx + c}$, where $a$, $b$, and
$c$ are constants and ${a \neq 1,}$ that tells us that our original square
has an area of ${ax^2}$. That $a$ makes computations needlessly difficult,
and we want our original shape to be a square of area ${x^2}$. Since $a$ is
a constant, we can get rid of its place before $x$ by dividing all of the
terms in the equation by $a:$

$$
	x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x + \dfrac{c}{a} = 0.
$$

We can then move the term ${\dfrac{c}{a}}$ to the right side of the
equation, to give us our incomplete shape:

$$
	x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x = - \dfrac{c}{a}
$$

The term ${b/a}$ represents the side of our added rectangle. The side of
our halved rectangles then, is ${\frac{b/a}{2} = \frac{b}{2a}}$. And since
${\frac{b}{2a}}$ represents the side of our halved rectangles, the missing
square has an area of
${\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right) = \frac{b^2}{4a},}$
the term we add to both sides of
${x^2 + \left(\frac{b}{a}\right)x = - \frac{c}{a}.}$

### The Quadratic Formula

The truth set for quadratic equations cannot be found by simple
factorization. Instead, a more robust formula must be used: the quadratic
formula.

From the method of completing the square, we can derive the quadratic
formula, a formula that allows us to quickly deduce the truth set of a
quadratic equation. To derive the formula, we begin wtih the general
quadratic equation: ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a \neq 0.}$ We divide
both sides by $a$, and obtain:

$$
	x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x + \left( \dfrac{c}{a} \right) = 0.
$$

Then we subtract ${\dfrac{c}{a}}$ from both sides, and obtain:

$$
	x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x = - \left( \dfrac{c}{a} \right)
$$

Now we comlete the square, by adding ${\dfrac{b^2}{4a^2}}$ to both sides:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x + \dfrac{b^2}{4a^2} &= \dfrac{b^2}{4a^2} - \dfrac{c}{a} \\
	\left( x + \dfrac{b}{2a} \right)^2 &= \dfrac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2} \\
	x + \dfrac{b}{2a} &= \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}}\\
	&= \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2 \lvert a \rvert } \\
	&= \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - rac}}{2a}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the truth set of the quadratic equation ${a^2 + bx + c = 0}$ is:

$$
	x \in \left\{-\dfrac{b}{2a} + \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \space - \dfrac{b}{2a} - \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \right\}
$$

The quadratic formula will always yield the truth set for quadratic
equations of the form ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0.}$ In the event that the term
${b^2 - 4ac \in \mathbb{R}^-}$ (the discriminant), however, the truth set
of the equation consists of complex numbers, rather than real numbers.

Thus, given a quadratic equation of the form ${ax^2 + bx +c}$, where $a$,
$b$, and $c$ are constants and ${a \neq 0}$, the truth set of the equation
can be found with the equation:

$$
	x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x + \dfrac{b^2}{4a} = - \dfrac{c}{a} + \dfrac{b^2}{4a}
$$

> Quadratic Formula. Given the quadratic equation ${ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 }$,
> where ${ a \neq 0, }$ the solutions are given by:
>
> $$
> 	x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} }{2a}
> $$

### The Discriminant

In the quadratic formula, the expression that appears below the radical
sign, ${b^2 - 4ac,}$ is called the discriminant. If the discriminant
evaluates to a positive real number, then the quadratic equation has 2 real
solutions. If the discriminant evaluates to 0, then the quadratic equation
has only 1 real solution. If the discriminant evaluates to a negative real
number, then the quadratic equation has no real solutions &mdash; instead,
it has a pair of complex conjugate solutions. Generalizing these results:

$$
	\text{roots} \begin{cases} \text{1 distinct real root} &\text{iff }
	b^2 - 4ac > 0 \\ \text{2 distinct real roots} &\text{iff } b^2 - 4ac =
	0 \\ \text{0 real roots} &\text{iff } b^2 - 4ac < 0 \end{cases}
$$

### The Product and Sum of Polynomial Roots

Suppose we were faced with the equation ${x^2 = 5 - 3x.}$ What are the
roots of this equation? First, let's rewrite the equation:

$$
	x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0.
$$

Then let's use the quadratic formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \\
&=\dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2-4(1)(-5)}}{2(1)} \\
&=\dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9+20}}{2} \\
&=\dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{29}}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the truth set of ${x^2 = 5 - 3x}$ is:

$$
	x \in \left\{ \dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2}, \space \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2}\right\}
$$

What would happen if we multiplied the two roots?

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\left( \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2} \right) \left( \dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2} \right) &= \dfrac{(-3)^2 - (\sqrt{29})^2}{4} \\
	&= \dfrac{9 - 29}{4}\\
	&= \dfrac{-20}{4} \\
	&= -5
\end{aligned}
$$

The product of the two roots is -5. What would happen if we added the two
roots?

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2} + \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2} &= \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29} + (-3) - \sqrt{29}}{2} \\
	&= \dfrac{-6}{2}\\
	&= -3
\end{aligned}
$$

The sum of the two roots is -3. Recall that the quadratic equation was
${x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0.}$ Is it pure coincidence that product of the two roots
is -5, the $c$ term in the equation, and the sum of the two roots, -3, is
the negative of the the $b$ term? Not a coincidence at all. In fact, it
follows from a more general rule.

> __lemma__. Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of the quadratic equation
> ${x^2 + bx + c = 0.}$ It follows that ${r_1 r_2 = c}$ and
> ${r_1 + r_2 = -b.}$ In other words, the product of the roots of
> ${x^2 + bx + c = 0}$ is the constant term in the equation, $c$, and the
> sum of the roots is the negative of the coefficient of the $x$ term, $b$
> (i.e., $-b$).

The general rule follows from manipulating the quadratic formula. Suppose
there exists a quadratic equation ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a = 1.}$
From the quadratic formula, it follows that the roots of the equation are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	x &= \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4(1)c}}{2(1)} \\[1em]
	&= \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the roots are:

$$
	r_1 = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} \\[1em]
	r_2 = \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}
$$

The products of the roots:

$$
	r_1 r_2 = \left(\dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}\right) \left( \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} \right) \\[1em]
	\phantom{r_1 r_2} = \dfrac{b^2 - \left( b^2 - 4c \right)}{4} = \dfrac{4c}{4} = c
$$

And the sum of the roots:

$$
	r_1 + r_2 = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} + \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} \\[1em]
	\phantom{r_1 + r_2} = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c} + (-b) - \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} = \dfrac{-2b}{2} = -b
$$

## The Factorial
A common operation in counting is the factorial. It is defined as follows:

> _Definition: Factorial_. Let ${n}$ be a positive integer. Then ${n!,}$
> read ${n}$ factorial, is denoted:
>
> $$
> 	n! = n \cdot (n - 1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \ldots \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1
> $$

Alongside the definition above is the following axiom:

> _Axiom: Zero Factorial_. The factorial of zero is one: $$ 0! = 1 $$

To illustrate, ${6!}$ is computed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
6! &= (6)(6-1)(6-2)(6-3)(6-4)(6-5)\\[1em]
&= (6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) \\[1em]
&= (6)(5)(2)(4)(3) \\[1em]
&= (6)(10)(12) \\[1em]
&= (6)(120) \\[1em]
&= 720
\end{aligned}
$$

## Binomial Coefficients

Suppose we had the following balls:

Our friend Leibniz comes up to us and says, Pick ${1.}$ How many possible
choices do we have? Well, we would have ${4}$ possible choices: A, B, C,
and D. Now what if Leibniz said, Pick ${2.}$ How many choices do we have
here? Well, we can count the number of possible choices: AB, AC, AD, BC,
BD, CD. These are six possible choices. In fact, we can layout these
possibilities:

Choose Possibilities Number of Possibilities

In mathematics, we have special syntax for expressing our thought process
above. When Leibniz says, Pick 1, we express this as:

$$
	\dbinom{4}{1}
$$

This notation is read "Four choose one." There are four balls, and we are
to pick one. When Leibniz says, Pick 2, we write this as:

$$
	\dbinom{4}{2}
$$

"Four choose two." And when Leibniz says, Pick 3, we have:

$$
	\dbinom{4}{3}
$$

"Four choose three." The notation ${\dbinom{n}{k}}$ is called a _binomial
coefficient_, and it is read as ${n}$ choose ${k.}$ Formally:

> Definition: Binomial Coefficient. For nonnegative integers ${n}$ and
> ${k,}$ where ${n \geq k,}$ the expression ${\binom{n}{k},}$ also written
> as ${_cC_k,}$ is called a binomial coefficient, and it is defined as:
>
> $$
> 	\dbinom{n}{k} = \dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}
> $$
>
> Otherwise, where ${k > n,}$ the binomial coefficient is defined as:
>
> $$
> 	\dbinom{n}{k} = 0
> $$

To understand where the binomial coefficient comes from, it's helpful to
illustrate by example. Suppose we had the following ingredients for a cup
of coffeee: coffee, milk, sugar. Now suppose we were asked, how many
possible ways are there to make a cup of sweet coffee? Well, we can
enumerate the number of ways with a table (where ${c}$ is for coffee, ${m}$
is for milk, and ${s}$ is for sugar):

| pick | possible picks         | number of possibilities |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 0    | 1                      |
| 1    | A, B, C, D             | 4                       |
| 2    | AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD | 6                       |
| 3    | ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD     | 4                       |
| 4    | ABCD                   | 1                       |

Reading the table above, we count six different orders. For example,
${(c, m, s)}$ is coffee, then milk, then sugar, and ${(s,m,c)}$ is sugar,
then milk, then coffee. This result follows directly from the
multiplication rule in counting. Since we have three different ingredients,
the number of recipes is yielded by:

$$
	3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
$$

Generalizing the multiplication rule, given ${n}$ ingredients and ${k}$
choices, we have:

$$
	n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \ldots \times (n - k + 1) = \dfrac{n!}{(n - k)!}
$$

Importantly, the question of how many different recipes there are is
distinct from asking: How many combinations of coffee, sugar, and milk are
there? The former requires a distinct order, while the latter does not. The
latter question &mdash; how many different combinations are there
(disregarding order) &mdash; is what the binomial coefficient attempts to
capture.

Hence, using our sweet coffee example, when write ${\dbinom{3}{2},}$ we are
expressing the number of combinations of two ingredients among three, where
order does not matter. If we enumerated all of the possibilities out on a
table:

Counting the number of possibilities, we have ${6.}$ But because we're
disregarding order, the table above is incorrect because we've overcounted.
Some of the possibilities are duplicated. As such, we must eliminate the
duplicates:

| ingredient | combination | combination |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| ${c}$      | ${(c, m)}$  | ${(c, s)}$  |
| ${m}$      | ${(m, c)}$  | ${(m, s)}$  |
| ${s}$      | ${(s, c)}$  | ${(s, m)}$  |

Notice that eliminating the overcount leaves us with three possibilities.
Further notice that this is half of our original count. This is no
coincidence. Looking back at our general formula for the multiplication
rule, we can see that eliminating the overcount is a matter of dividing by
a ${k!}$ term (since we've overcounted by a factor of ${k!}$):

$$
\begin{aligned} n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \ldots \times (n - k +
1) &= \dfrac{n!}{(n - k)!} \\[2em] \dfrac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)
\ldots \times (n - k + 1)}{k!} &= \dfrac{\dfrac{n!}{(n - k)!}}{k!} \\[2em]
&= \dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \end{aligned}
$$

And there it is &mdash; the binomial coefficient definition.

### Pascal's Triangle

Do we notice any patterns in this triangle? There are several. The Binomial
Theorem This is where the binomial theorem comes in handy:

> _Binomial Theorem_. For any positive integer ${n,}$ the following is
> true:
>
> $$
> \begin{aligned} (a + b)^n &= \sum\limits_{k = 0}^{n} \dbinom{n}{k}
> a^{n - k}b^k \\[2em] &= \dbinom{n}{0}a^n + \dbinom{n}{1}a^{n - 1}b +
> \dbinom{n}{2}a^{n-2}b^2 + \ldots + \dbinom{n}{n}b^n \end{aligned}
> $$

## Invervals
An __interval__ $I$ is a special kind of set. It is a subset of
${\mathbb{R}}$ with the property: If ${s \in I,}$ ${t \in I,}$ and
${s < x < t,}$ then ${x \in I.}$ In other words, an interval is simply a
set of real numbers with two explicit members, called __endpoints__, with
the added property that every number between the two endpoints is also an
element of the set. Because there are infinitely many real numbers between
two different real numbers, intervals with distinct endpoints have
infinitely many members.

Intervals can be restricted to include or exclude its endpoints. If the
interval excludes its endpoints, we say that the interval is an **open
interval**. If the interval includes its endpoints, we say that the
interval is an __open interval__.

Because of the special place intervals have in continuous mathematics, they
have two different forms of notation: interval notation, and set notation.
The table below lists some common intervals in both interval and set
notation.

| Interval Notation        | Set Notation                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| ${[a, b]}$               | ${\{x \in \mathbb{R} : a \leq x \leq b\}}$ |
| ${(a,b)}$                | ${\{x \in \mathbb{R} : a < x < b\}}$       |
| ${[a, b)}$               | ${\{ x \in \mathbb{R} : a \leq x < b \}}$  |
| ${(a, b]}$               | ${\{ x \in \mathbb{R} : a < x \leq b \}}$  |
| ${(a, + \infty)}$        | ${\{ x \in \mathbb{R} : x > a \}}$         |
| ${[a, + \infty)}$        | ${\{ x \in \mathbb{R} : x \geq a \}}$      |
| ${(- \infty, b)}$        | ${\{ x \in \mathbb{R} : x < b \}}$         |
| ${(- \infty, b]}$        | ${\{ x \in \mathbb{R} : x \leq b \}}$      |
| ${(- \infty, + \infty)}$ | ${\mathbb{R}}$                             |

To graphically indicate that an interval includes its endpoints, we color
in the the dot marking the endpoint. To indicate exclusion, we leave the
mark unfilled.

Suppose the interval ${(a, b) \in \mathbb{R}^2,}$ and ${a < b.}$ Now
suppose there is a number ${\lambda \in [0,1].}$ Since ${a < b}$, we can
infer ${a - b < 0.}$ We know that
${\lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda){b} = b + \lambda{(a-b)}}$ (simplifying this
expression will yield ${0 = 0}$.) Since ${a - b < 0,}$ we can solve for
$b$: ${b = b + 0(a - b) \leq b + 1(a - b) = a.}$

Now suppose there is a number ${x \in [a,b],}$ and that
${x = \lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda){b}.}$ Solving for ${\lambda,}$ we obtain
${\lambda = \dfrac{x - b}{b - a}.}$ Given that ${0 \leq x - b \leq b - a,}$
it is evident that ${0 \leq \lambda \leq 1.}$

Thus, we can infer the following rule:

> __lemma__. Given the open interval ${(a,b) \in \mathbb{R^2}}$ and
> ${a < b,}$ every number of the form ${\lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda)b,}$ >
> ${\lambda \in [0,1]}$ belongs to the interval ${[a,b].}$ Conversely, if
> ${x \in [a,b],}$ then we can find a ${\lambda \in [0,1]}$ such that
> ${x = \lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda){b}.}$

### Neighborhoods

Suppose ${a \in \mathbb{R}.}$ The set $\mathcal{N}_a$ is a __neighborhood__
of $a$ if: There exists an open inteval $I$ centered at $a$ such that
${I \subseteq \mathcal{N}_a.}$ I.e., $\mathcal{N} _a$ is a neighborhood of
$a$ if there exists a ${\delta > 0}$ such that the open interval
${(a - \delta, a + \delta) \subseteq \mathcal{N}_a.}$

If $\mathcal{N}_a$ is a neighborhood of $a$, then the notation
${\mathcal{N}_a \setminus \{ a \}}$ signifies the __deleted neighborhood__
of $a$. This implies that ${\mathcal{N}_a}$ is a neighborhood of $a$ if $a$
has neighbors left and right.

For example, consider the following intervals:

<Plot
	geo={[
		{ type: "line", start: [-10, 5], end: [10, 5] },
		{ type: "line", start: [-5, 5], end: [5, 5], class: 'red'},
		{ type: "line", start: [-10, 3], end: [10, 3] },
		{ type: "line", start: [0, 3], end: [5, 3], class: 'red'},
		{ type: "line", start: [-10, 1], end: [10, 1] },
		{ type: "line", start: [-5, 1], end: [0, 1], class: 'red'},
		{ type: "point", xy: [-5, 5] },
		{ type: "point", xy: [5, 5] },
		{ type: "point", xy: [5, 3] },
		{ type: "point", xy: [-5, 1] },
		{ type: "point", xy: [0, 3] },
		{ type: "point", xy: [0, 5] },
		{ type: "point", xy: [0, 1] },
		{ type: "label", id: "a", xy: [0.25, 6.3],fontSize:0.8},
		{ type: "label", id: "a", xy: [0.25, 4.3],fontSize:0.8},
		{ type: "label", id: "a", xy: [0.25, 2.3],fontSize:0.8},
		{ type: "label", id: "a+\\delta", xy: [5.2, 4.3], w: 30,fontSize:0.8},
		{ type: "label", id: "a+\\delta", xy: [5.2, 6.3], w: 30,fontSize:0.8},
		{ type: "label", id: "a-\\delta", xy: [-6.5, 6.3], w: 30,fontSize:0.8},
		{ type: "label", id: "a-\\delta", xy: [-6.5, 2.3], w: 30,fontSize:0.8},
	]}
	id="interval1"
	noTicks={true}
	noAxes={true}
	margins={[0, 0, 100, 0]}
	containerHeight={"50%"}
	height={400}
	width={400}
/>

The first interval demarcates the neighborhood of $a$. The second
interval demarcates the _sinistral neighborhood_ of $a$. Finally, the
third interval demarcates the _dextral neighborhood_ of $a$.
More formally:

> __lemma__. Let ${a \in \mathbb{R}.}$ The set ${V \subseteq \mathbb{R}}$ is
> a __dextral neighborhood__ (right-hand) of $a$ if there exists a
> ${\delta > 0}$ such that ${[a, a + \delta) \subseteq V.}$ The set
> ${V' \subseteq \mathbb{R}}$ is a __sinistral neighborhood__ (left-hand)
> of $a$ if there exists a ${\delta' > 0}$ such that
> ${(a - \delta', a] \subseteq V'.}$

In sum, neighborhoods are open intervals centered at a particular real
number $a.$ They can be large or small. The intervals ${(-1000, 1000)}$,
${(-0.00001, 0.00001)}$, and ${(-\pi, \pi)}$ are all neighborhoods of the
real number 0. Moreover, we can restrict our discussion to certain sections
of the neighborhood: the sinistral (left-hand) and dextral (right-hand)
neighborhoods. For example, the interval ${(-100, 0]}$ is the sinistral
neighborhood of 0, and the interval ${[0, 100)}$ is the dextral
neighborhood of 0.

A neighborhood is free to include or exclude its _reference point_. Thus, where ${a \in \mathbb{R},}$ the ${\delta \text{-neighborhood} }$ of $a$ is defined as ${U_{\delta}(a) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : \lvert x - a \rvert < \delta \}.}$ This particular set is simply called the neighborhood of $a$, and the variable ${U_{\delta}(a)}$ is equivalent to ${\mathcal{N}_a}$. If, however, we were to exclude the reference point $a$, then we obtain what is called a __reduced neighborhood__&mdash;the set ${P_{\delta}(a) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < \lvert x - a \rvert < \delta \}.}$ Thus, the difference between a _neighborhood of $a$_ and a _reduced neighborhood of $a$_ is that the reduced neighborhood of $a$ excludes the reference point $a$, whereas the neighborhood of $a$ includes $a$.

## The Cartesian Plane
Continuous mathematics depends heavily on graphs. One way to represent
graphs is through the Cartesian plane:

<Plot geo={[
	{type:'label', xy: [4,5], id: '\\reals^+ \\times \\reals^+', fontSize:0.9,w:60},
	{type:'label', xy: [-7,5], id: '\\reals^- \\times \\reals^+', fontSize:0.9,w:60},
	{type:'label', xy: [-7,-4], id: '\\reals^- \\times \\reals^-', fontSize:0.9,w:60},
	{type:'label', xy: [4,-4], id: '\\reals^+ \\times \\reals^-', fontSize:0.9,w:60},
]}/>

The Cartesian plane consists of two perpendicular real number lines. The
point where the lines intersect is 0, and is called the __origin__. The
horizontal number line is usually called the x-axis, and the vertical
number line the $y$-axis. On the $x$-axis, all points to the right of
the origin represent the positive real numbers, and all points to the left
of the origin represent the negative real numbers. On the $y$-axis, all
points above the origin reprepresent the positive real numbers, and all
points below the origin represent the negative real numbers.

A point on the Cartesian plane is represented by an __ordered pair__, of
the form ${ x, y }$, where ${ x }$ is a point on the $x$-axis, and ${ y }$
is a point on the $y$-axis. For example:

<Plot geo={[
	{type: 'point', xy: [2,2]},
	{type: 'label', xy: [2,2],id:'(2,2)'},
	{type: 'point', xy: [3,5]},
	{type: 'label', xy: [3,5],id:'(3,5)'},
	{type: 'point', xy: [-7,4]},
	{type: 'label', xy: [-7,4],id:'(-7,4)'},
	{type: 'point', xy: [-8,1]},
	{type: 'label', xy: [-8,1],id:'(-8,1)'},
	{type: 'point', xy: [-4,-4]},
	{type: 'label', xy: [-4,-4],id:'(-4,-4)'},
	{type: 'point', xy: [2,-8]},
	{type: 'label', xy: [2,-8],id:'(2,-8)'},
	{type: 'point', xy: [8,-3]},
	{type: 'label', xy: [8,-3],id:'(8,-3)'},
]}
	
/>

Each of the points in the diagram above are __Cartesian coordinates__, or
simply _coordinates_. The $x$-coordinate is formally called the
__abscissa__ of the point, and the $y$-coordinate the __ordinate__. When we
refer to coordinates generally, or in the abstract, we write:

$$
	P(x,y)
$$

The notation above is read "the point ${ (x,y) }$."

## The Distance Formula
The Cartesian plane constructs a bridge between algebra and geometry. Many
theorems and ideas from geometry can be applied in continuous mathematics.
One such theorem is the Pythagorean theorem:

> __theorem__. Given a right trangle, the lengths of the sides are related by
> the equation: ${a^2 + b^2 = c^2,}$ where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are the lengths
> of the sides forming the right triangle, and ${c}$ is the length of the
> hypotentuse.

Conversely, if ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${c}$ are the sides of a triangle, and all
three lengths are related by an equation of the form ${a^2 + b^2 = c^2,}$
then the triangle is a right triangle, and ${c}$ is the hypotenuse.

We can visualize the Pythagorean Theorem with the following diagram:

The Pythagorean Theorem leads directly to the __Distance Formula__, an
equation that allows us to compute the distance between two points on the
Cartesian plane:

> \end{aligned}
> $$

## Functions

Functions. What are they? At the most basic level, a function is a rule
assigning a number to another number. At a more abstract level, a function
is a _relation_ between mathematical objects. There are many relations in
mathematics (equality, inequality, congruence, proximity, etc.). Functions
are just one kind of relation. Most commonly, functions are relations
between numbers, where one number shares a specific relationship, defined
by a rule, to exactly one number. More explicitly: A function is a rule
that assigns one number to another number. Do not confuse this idea of
"one-to-one" with "one-to-unique." A relation can still be a function even
if one or more numbers are related to the same number.

Functions can be represented in a variety of ways. We can represent
functions algebraically, using an equation or formula: ${f(x) = \ln x,}$
${g = \sqrt{h}}$, or ${F = ma}$. We can represent functions verbally: "For
every $x$, there is a $y$ such that $y$ is $x$ squared." We can represent
functions with tables, where one column lists the values of $x$, and
another lists their corresponding $y$ values. Finally, we can represent
functions with graphs, using a coordinate system. Regardless of the way we
represent them, functions all express the same idea: a relationship where
one mathematical object maps to exactly one mathematical object, according
to a rule.

A more formal definition:

> __definition__. Let $A$ and $B$ be nonempty sets. A __function__ from $A$
> to $B$ is a _rule of correspondence_ that assigns, or maps, to each
> element in $A$ _exactly one_ element in ${B.}$

Consider the following relations:

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1654218453/math/functions_or_not_dc6jh8.svg"
	}
	caption={"Various relations"}
	width={"30"}
	imwidth={"252"}
	imheight={"472"}
/>

The relation $u$ maps the elements of $A$ to the elements of ${B.}$ The
relation $v$ maps the elements of $C$ to the elements of ${D.}$ And the
relation $w$ maps the elements of $E$ to the elements of ${F.}$ The
relation $u$ is a function, since it maps each element of $A$ to exactly
one element of $B.$ The same goes for relation $v$ &mdash; each element of
$C$ is mapped to exactly one element of ${D,}$ even if some elements of $C$
map to the same element of ${D.}$ The relation ${w,}$ however, is _not_ a
function, since at least one element of $E$ is mapped to more than one
element of ${F.}$

We often refer to the inputs of a function with the variable $x$, and the
outputs of the function with the variable $y$, or $f(x)$. The input, $x$,
is also called the _independent variable_, and the output, $f(x)$, is
called the _dependent_ variable.

A function will never give more than one output for one input. There are,
of course, relationships where on number outputs more than one number.
Those relationships, however, are not characterized by, or as, functions.
We will explore those relationships later in due time.

> __definition__ Given two sets $A$ and $B$, the set Cartesian product
> $A \times B$ the set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$, where $a \in A$ and
> $b \in B$. A subset of $A \times B$ is called a __relation__.

A __function__ is a special kind of relation. It is a pairing of elements
in $A$ with elements in $B$, where each eleemnt in $A$ is paired with
exactly one element in $B$. Thus, a function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is a rule
or relation between $A$ and $B$ that _assigns_, or _maps_, each element
$a \in A$ to _one_ element in $b \in B$.

If a function is a subset of $A \times B$, then $A$ is the __domain__ of
the function, and $B$ is the __range__ of the function.

Every function has a __natural domain__ (also called the _implied domain_).
The natural domain of a function is the set of all elements for which the
function is defined. Whenever we analyze or discuss a function, we set a
natural domain. That natural domain acts as the boundary of our analysis.
For example, when we discuss the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, we may specify
that the natural domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$. Because the natural domain
of $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$, the domain of $f$ cannot include negative real
numbers, since $\sqrt{x}$ is undefined for $\mathbb{R}^{-}$. Because of
this fact, we specify the domain of $f$ as:

$$
	dom(f) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \geq 0 \}
$$

### Properties of Functions

Functions can be identified by several properties:

1. A set of inputs, called the function's __domain__, denoted ${dom(f),}$
   e.g., the domain of the function ${f(x) = x^2}$ is
   ${dom(f) = \mathbb{R}.}$
2. A set of all _possible_ inputs, called the function's **natural
   domain**, denoted ${D(f),}$ e.g., the natural domain of the function
   ${c(d) = \sqrt{d}}$ is ${ D(c) = \mathbb{R}}$, but the domain of the
   function is ${dom(d) = \{ d \in \mathbb{R} \mid d \geq 0 \}.}$ In set
   notation, given a function ${f,}$ ${dom(f) \subseteq D(f).}$
3. A set of outputs, called the function's __range__, or __image__, denoted
   ${ran(f)}$ or ${Im(f),}$ e.g., the function ${y(w) = \dfrac{1}{w}}$ has
   the range of ${Im(y) = \mathbb{R}.}$
4. A set of all _possible_ outputs, called the function's __codomain__, or
   __target__, denoted ${\text{target}(f),}$ e.g., the function
   ${h(z) = z + 1}$ has a codomain of ${\text{target}(h) = \mathbb{R},}$
   but if we restricted ${dom(h) = \{ 1,2 \},}$ then ${Im(h) = \{ 2,3 \},}$
   but its codomain remains ${\text{target}(h) = \mathbb{R}.}$ In set
   notation, given a function ${f,}$ ${Im(f) \subseteq \text{target}(f);}$
5. A name for a typical input, called a __dummy variable__, e.g., the
   function ${g(p) = \dfrac{1}{p} }$ has the dummy variable $p$.
6. A name for the function, e.g., the function ${m(j) = \ln j}$ has the
   name ${m(j).}$
7. An assignment rule or formula assigning to every element of the domain
   exactly one element of the __codomain__, e.g., the function
   ${r(t) = t^2 + 4t + 1}$ has the assignment rule ${t^2 + 4t + 1.}$
8. Some functions have graphs, denoted ${G(f).}$ (We say "some" because a
   function need not concern numbers. A relation mapping common fruit names
   to their respective scientific names is just as much a function as
   ${s(t) = \sqrt{t - 1}.)}$

### Arrow Notation
Functions can be represented in arrow notation:

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1654218662/math/properties_functions_mapping_but937.svg"
	}
	caption={"Function mapping"}
	width={"50"}
	imwidth={"231"}
	imheight={"93"}
/>

For example, the function ${f(x) = x^2}$, in arrow notation, is
${f: x \mapsto x^2,}$ and its domain and codomain are represented as
${\mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}.}$ The benefit of arrow notation is that it
allows us to easily restrict a function's inputs and outputs, which in turn
allows us to differentiate functions explicitly. This is a particularly
useful asset when the functions share the same assignment rule:

Suppose the function ${f(x) = x^3 + 3x + 4.}$ The functions below all have
the same assignment rule as ${f,}$ but they are all different functions:

- ${f: x \mapsto x^3 + 3x + 4;}$ ${f: \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}.}$
- ${g: x \mapsto x^3 + 3x + 4;}$ ${g: \mathbb{R} \mapsto [0, + \infty).}$
- ${h: x \mapsto x^3 + 3x + 4;}$ ${h: [0, + \infty) \mapsto \mathbb{R}.}$
- ${i: x \mapsto x^3 + 3x + 4;}$
  ${i: [0, + \infty) \mapsto [0, + \infty).}$

The function $f$ is neither injective nor surjective, the function $b$ is
injective but not surjective, the function $c$ is surjective but not
injective, and the function $d$ is a bijection.

Note that in the last function, the function name $i$ was used. This is
generally considered poor writing in mathematics, as the letter $i$ is
almost always exclusively reserved for the imaginary number $i$ (setting
aside the unorthodox practices of electrical engineers using $j$).

## Function Graphs

A function with a domain and range of real numbers can be graphed. When
graphing functions, we use two axes—a horizontal axis for the function's
domain (i.e., inputs) and vertical axis for function's range (i.e.,
outputs). We call the input axis the ${\text{x-axis}}$ and the output axis
the ${\text{y-axis.}}$

> Definition. Given a function ${f,}$ the graph of ${f}$ on the ${x-y}$
> plane consists of those points ${(x, y)}$ such that ${x}$ is the domain
> of ${f}$ and ${y = f(x).}$

### The Vertical Line Test

The vertical line test allows us to determine if a particular graph
represents a function. This is a particularly helpful result when we aren't
provided any equation for a possible function, or if we are uncertain about
what sets the function maps to and from.

> A graph in the ${x-y}$ plane represents a function of $x$ iff any
> vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point.

For example, the graph below is not a function, since the blue vertical
line passes through the plot at more than one point:

<Plot
	functions={[
		{ f: (x) => Math.sqrt(x), color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: (x) => -Math.sqrt(x), color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: 5, color: "var(--red)", color: "var(--blue)", dash: 6 },
	]}
	id="nonfunction"
/>

### Graphing Transformations

Graphs of functions serve as a bridge between geometry and algebra.
Crossing from geometry to algebra are the definitions of _reflection_,
_translation_, and _scaling_. All of these defines are broadly referred to
as __transformations__—if we reflect, translate, or scale a function's
graph, we are _transforming_ the function's graph.

### Vertical Translation

When we vertically translate a graph, we either shift the graph up or down
the y-axis. For example, the following are vertical translations of the
graph ${f(x) = x^2.}$

<Plot
	functions={[
		{ f: (x) => x ** 2, color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: (x) => x ** 2 + 1, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ f: (x) => x ** 2 + 2, color: "var(--green)" },
	]}
	geo={[
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = x^2",
			xy: [2, 0.8],
			w: 60,
			fill: "var(--red)",
		},
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = x^2 + 1",
			xy: [2, 1.8],
			w: 60,
			fill: "var(--blue)",
		},
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = x^2 + 2",
			xy: [2, 2.8],
			w: 60,
			fill: "var(--green)",
		},
	]}
	domain={[-5, 5]}
	range={[-5, 5]}
	id="vertical_translation"
/>

Observe that when add a positive constant to the function's expression, we
shift the graph up the $y$-axis. And when we add a negative constant (i.e.,
subtraction) to the function's expression, we shift the grown down the
$y$-axis. This logically follows from the fact that we are essentially
adding a constant value to each element in the function's _range_. In other
words, for every output, add or substract some constant—shift the graph up
or down respectively.

> __definition__. Let ${f(x)}$ be a function and ${c}$ a constant, where
> ${c \in \reals.}$ Suppose ${y = f(x).}$ Substituting ${y}$ with ${y - c},$ we
> obtain ${y - c = f(x),}$ which is equivalent to ${y = f(x) + c.}$ This is

>

> which shifts ${G(f)}$ by ${c}$ units _down_ the $y$-axis.
>
> If ${c = 0,}$ then there is no transformation, and _a fortiori_, no
> vertical translation.

### Horizontal Translation

When we _horizontally translate_ a graph, we either shift the graph left or
right along the $x$-axis. In essence, we are are adding or subtracting some
constant from each element in the function's _domain_: For every input, add
or substract some constant value. Horizontal translations, however, are a
common source of error.

Consider again the graph of ${y = x^2.}$ To shift the graph to the right,
we add some negative constant ${c}$ to every input. Thus, ${y = (x - c)^2}$
indicates a shift ${c}$ units to the right along the $x$-axis. Why is it a
shift right? Because to get back to the original function ${y}$, we have to
add ${c}$ units. It is the same logic behind why scrolling down with a
mouse wheel moves this page up, or why a gear moving clockwise turns a
second gear counter-clockwise. For example, given ${y = x^2,}$ the
parabola's vertex is ${(0,0).}$ However, given ${y = (x-1)^2,}$ the
parabola's vertex is now ${(1,0);}$ a shift to the right.

In contrast, given ${y = (x + c)^2,}$ we have a horizontal shift to the
_left_. Again, consider ${y = x^2.}$ The parabola is ${(0, 0).}$ When
${y = (x + 1)^2,}$ the vertex is now ${(-1, 0);}$ a shift to the left.
Below are horizontal translations:

<Plot
	functions={[
		{ f: (x) => x ** 2, color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: (x) => (x - 1) ** 2, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ f: (x) => (x + 1) ** 2, color: "var(--green)" },
	]}
	geo={[
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = x^2",
			xy: [3.5, 0.8],
			w: 70,
			fill: "var(--red)",
		},
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = (x-1)^2",
			xy: [3.5, 1.8],
			w: 70,
			fill: "var(--blue)",
		},
		{
			type: "label",
			id: "f(x) = (x+1)^2",
			xy: [3.5, 2.8],
			w: 70,
			fill: "var(--green)",
		},
	]}
	domain={[-5, 5]}
	range={[-5, 5]}
	id="horizontal_translation"
/>

In sum: If we subtract a constant, we shift right; add a constant, we shift
left.

## Slope

The graph of an equation is the set of all points with coordinates
satisfying the equation. For example, suppose we had the equation
${y = x^2 + 1}$. Does the point ${(3,10)}$ lie on the equation's graph?
Yes. Plugging ${(3,10)}$ into the equation ${y = x^2 + 1}$, we get
${10 = (3)^2 + 1 = 9 + 10}$, which is true. Thus, the point ${3,10}$ does
indeed lie on the graph.

At very small intervals, graphs can be viewed as lines. Lines can either
slant or remain straight, but in both cases, the line has a __slope__
&mdash; a number that measures the line's direction.

> Definition. Given two points, ${(x_1, y_1)}$ and ${(x_2, y_2)}$, the
> slope of the line passing through the two points is the number $m$:

$$
	m = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

For example, suppose we had two points, ${(-2,-1)}$ and ${(3,5)}$. On the
Cartesian plane, these two points appear as:

<Plot
	geo={[
		{ type: "point", xy: [-2, 1] },
		{ type: "label", xy: [-4, 2], id: "(-2,1)" },
		{ type: "point", xy: [3, 5] },
		{ type: "label", xy: [3, 5], id: "(3,5)" },
		{ type: "line", start: [-2, 1], end: [3, 5] },
	]}
	id="2pointPlot"
/>

The line between these two points is:

$$
	m = \dfrac{5-1}{3-(-2)} = \dfrac{4}{5}
$$

Thus, the line between ${(-2,1)}$ and ${(3,5)}$ has a slope of
${\frac{4}{5}}$. The slope equation can also be written as:

$$
	m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$

The variable $\Delta y$ represents the change in $y$-coordinates
(${y_2 - y_1}$), and the variable $\Delta x$ represents the change in
$x$-coordinates (${x_2 - x_1}$).

### Comparing Slopes

The slope $m$ of a line is a real number (${m \in \mathbb{R}}$). Thus, $m$
can be a member of only one of three subsets:

1. ${m \in \mathbb{R}^-}$
2. ${m = 0}$
3. ${m \in \mathbb{R}^+}$

If $m$ is a negative real number &mdash; ${m \in \mathbb{R}^-}$ &mdash;
then the line slants downwards to the right. If $m$ is a positive real
number &mdash; ${m \in \mathbb{R}^+}$ &mdash; then the line slants upwards
to the right. If ${m = 0}$, then the line is a perfectly straight
_horizontal_ line.

Given the Cartesian plane, one might wonder, aren't there two cases for
straight lines: (a) a vertical straight line or (b) a horizontal straight
line? Yes, there are indeed two cases, straight horizontal lines and
straight vertical lines. But, the slope is not defined for a vertical line.
If the two points share the same ordinate (the ${y \text{-coordinate}}$),
then the line is a horizontal line (e.g., ${(a,b), (c,b)}$). If, however,
the two points share the same abscissa (the ${x \text{-coordinate}}$), then
the line is a vertical line (e.g., ${(a,b), (a,c)}$), but the slope is not
defined. This is because calculating the slope for such a line would lead
to an undefined result:

$$
	m = \dfrac{b - c}{a - a} = \dfrac{b - c}{0}
$$

Does the magnitude, or size, of $m$ yield any inferences? Yes.
${\lvert m \rvert }$ represents the "steepness" of the line. The larger
${\lvert m \rvert }$ is, the steeper the line slants (i.e., tending towards
a straight vertical line), and the smaller ${\lvert m \rvert }$ is, the
less the line's steepness (i.e., tending towards a straight horizontal
line).

### The Point-Slope Formula

The slope formula can be rearranged in another form, yielding the
__point-slope formula__.

> _Formula_. Given a point $P_1{(x_1, y_1)}$, the equation of the line
> passing through ${P_1}$ is given by the equation:
>
> $$
> 	y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
> $$

Because of the point-slope formula, it follows that the equation of a
horizontal line is simply the ordinate of ${P_1}$. For example, suppose
${P_1 = (4, -2)}$. A horizontal line is a line where ${m = 0}$, so it
follows that the line's equation is:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		y - (-2) &= 0(x - 4)
		y &= -2
	\end{aligned}
$$

We know that a horizontal line will always have a slope of ${m = 0}$. For
vertical lines, only the $y$-coordinate varies, and the $x$-coordinate
remains the same. Thus, we can state more general rules for horizontal and
vertical lines:

> _Rule_. Given a point ${P_1(a,b)}$, the equation of a line passing
> through ${P_1}$ is ${y = b}$.

> _Rule_. Given a point ${P_2(a,b)}$, the equation of a line passing
> through ${P_2}$ is ${x = a}$.

### Slope-Intercept Formula

If we know that a line passes through the point ${(0,b)}$, then we can
derive yet another equation for a line: the __slope-intercept form__. Since
the line passes through ${(0,b)}$ (i.e., the line crosses the $y$-axis),
using the _point-slope formula_, we can conclude that ${y - b = m(x-0)}$.
Simplifying and adding $b$ to both sides of the equation, we obtain the
following rule.

> _Formula_. Given a line with slope $m$ and a $y$-intercept $b$, the
> equation of the line is given by the equation:
>
> $$
> 	y = mx + b
> $$

If we know that a point satisfies this equation, then it must be the case
that it lies on the line with the equation. Furthermore, whenever we see an
equation of this form, we should be immediately aware that the equation
graphically represents a line.

### Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

In geometry, we can easily notice that parallel lines slant in the same
direction (i.e., they have the same "steepness" to their slant):

<Plot
	functions={[
		{ f: (x) => 2 * x, color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: (x) => 2 * x + 2, color: "var(--blue)" },
		{ f: (x) => 2 * x - 2, color: "var(--green)" },
	]}
	id="parallel_lines"
/>

Because perpendicular lines have the same slant, in algebraic terms, the
lines have the same slope. Thus, given line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm AB}}$
(where $A$ and $B$ are two arbitrary points on the line) with the slope
$m_1$ and the line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm CD}}$ (where $C$ and $D$ are
two arbitary points on the line) with the slope $m_2$, the lines
${\overleftrightarrow{\rm AB}}$ and ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm CD}}$ are
parallel if, and only if, ${m_1 = m_2}$. In other words, two lines are
parallel, if and only if, they have the same slope.

In contrast, perpendicular lines slant in the exact opposite direction,
forming 90 degree angles:

<Plot
	functions={[
		{ f: (x) => 2 * x + 3, color: "var(--red)" },
		{ f: (x) => -0.5 * x - 3, color: "var(--blue)" },
	]}
	id="perpendicular_lines"
/>

Given that two lines are perpendicular if and only if they form 90 degree
angles, it follows that for a line to be parallel to another line, the
line's slope must be the negative reciprocal of the other line. Thus, given
a line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm EF}}$ (where $E$ and $F$ are arbitrary
points on the line) with the slope $m_1$ and a line
${\overleftrightarrow{\rm GH}}$ (where $G$ and $H$ are arbirary points on
the line) with the slope $m_2$, lines ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm EF}}$ and
${\overleftrightarrow{\rm GH}}$ are perpendicular if, and only if,
${m_1 = - \dfrac{1}{m_2}}$.

To see why a perpendicular line's slope must be the negative reciprocal of
the other line, consider the following: First, suppose we have three lines,
$\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, and the vertical line ${x = 1}$. Now suppose that
${\ell_1 \perp \ell_2}$, ${\ell_1}$ has a slope ${m_1}$, and ${\ell_2}$ has
a slope ${m_2}$. Finally, suppose that ${\ell_1}$ and ${\ell_2}$ intersect
at the origin, ${(0,0)}$. The lines can be visually represented as:

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1654218228/math/proof_perpendicular_lines_w4tk4l.svg"
	}
	caption={"Perpendicular lines"}
	width={"50"}
	imwidth={"441"}
	imheight={"455"}
/>

Since ${\ell_1 \perp \ell_2}$, we know that that the vertical line
${x = 1}$ intersects ${\ell_1}$ at ${(1, m_1)}$ and ${\ell_2}$ at
${(1,m_2).}$ This is because both lines have a ${\Delta x = 1.}$

Where ${\ell_1}$ and ${\ell_2}$ intersect, a right angle, ${\angle ABC}$,
is formed, since perpendicular lines form right angles. Thus, it follows
that there is a right triangle ${\triangle ABC,}$ since the resulting
triangle from ${\angle ABC}$ forms a right triangle.

Now, consider the distance between the origin, ${B(0,0)}$, and the point
${A(1,m_1)}$. From the distance formula, the length of
${\overline{\rm BA}}$ (the distance between $B$ and $A$) is
${\overline{\rm BA} = \sqrt{1 + {m_1}^2}.}$ Similarly,
${\overline{\rm BC} = \sqrt{1 + {m_2}^2}.}$ Thus,
${\overline{\rm AC} = \sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (m_1-m_2)^2} = m_1 - m_2.}$

From this analysis, we now know all of the lengths of the sides of
${\triangle ABC}$:

1. ${\overline{\rm BA} = \sqrt{1+{m_1}^2}}$
2. ${\overline{\rm BC} = \sqrt{1+{m_2}^2}}$
3. ${\overline{\rm AC} = m_1 - m_2}$

Because we know the lengths for all of the sides of ${\triangle ABC,}$ we
can express ${\triangle ABC}$ as an equation with the Pythagorean Theorem:

$$
	(\sqrt{1+{m_1}^2})^2 + (\sqrt{1+{m_2}^2})^2 = (m_1 - m_2)^2
$$

With this form, we can isolate ${m_1}$ and ${m_2}$ to separate sides of the
equation:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		1 + {m_1}^2 + 1 + {m_2}^2 &= (m_1 - m_2)^2 \\
		2 + {m_1}^2 + {m_2}^2 &= {m_1}^2 - 2{m_1}{m_2} + {m_2}^2 \\
		2 &= -2{m_1}{m_2} \\
		-1 &= {m_1}{m_2} \\
		m_1 &= - \dfrac{1}{m_2} \\
	\end{aligned}
$$

The analysis above applies regardless of where the point of intersection
is, since perpendicular lines will always form right triangles.
Accordingly, it follows that given a line ${\ell_1}$ with the slope ${m_1}$
and a line ${\ell_2}$ with the slope ${m_2}$, for ${\ell_1 \perp \ell_2}$
to be true, it must be the case that ${m_1 = - \dfrac{1}{m_2}}$.
