# Combinatroics

This volume provides an overview of combinatorics.

## Terminology

We begin with some basic terminology we'll use extensively.



## Permutations

If a sequence is bijective, then members of the domain — a natural number — map
to each element of the codomain (the sequence's terms) exactly once. And if term
gets one, and only one, index, then we know that each element of the sequence is
unique. That is, there are no duplicates.

It's a good idea to have a separate word for this collection, since sequence's
allow duplicates, but this collection does not. Fortunately there is such a word
— this collection is called a _permutation_.

<dfn>

__permutation.__ A permutation of a set ${S}$ is a sequence containing every
element in ${S}$ exactly once.

</dfn>

A more formal definition:

<dfn>

__permutation.__ A permutation ${P}$ is a bijection from ${\seq{n}}$ to a given
set ${S.}$

$$
	P : \Seq{n} \bij S
$$

</dfn>

### Factorial

Question: How many permuations of ${\seq{n} \bij \seq{n}}$ are there? Well,
let's try some numbers. Suppose ${n = 0.}$ Well, if ${n = 0,}$ then we get the
empty set, ${\nil.}$ There's only one way to order ${\nil}$ — ${\nil.}$ How
about when ${n = 1?}$ Well, when ${n = 1,}$ we have the mapping:

$$
	\set{(0,0)}
$$

That's 1 again. How about when ${n = 2?}$ Then we have two possible mappings:

<Grid cols={2}>

$$
	\set{(0,0), (1,1)}
$$

$$
	\set{(0,1), (1,0)}
$$

</Grid>

Or, in sequence notation:

<Grid cols={2}>

$$
	\seq{0, 1}
$$

$$
	\seq{1, 0}
$$

</Grid>

How about when ${n = 3?}$ Then we have six possible mappings:

<Grid cols={3}>

$$
	\set{(0,0),  (1, 1),  (2, 2)}
$$

$$
	\set{(0,0),  (1, 2),  (2, 1)}
$$

$$
	\set{(0,1),  (1, 2),  (2, 0)}
$$

$$
	\set{(0,1),  (1, 0),  (2, 2)}
$$

$$
	\set{(0,2),  (1, 0),  (2, 1)}
$$

$$
	\set{(0,2),  (1, 1),  (2, 0)}
$$

</Grid>

In sequence notation:

<Grid cols={3}>

$$
	\seq{0,1,2}
$$

$$
	\seq{0,2,1}
$$

$$
	\seq{1,2,0}
$$

$$
	\seq{1,0,2}
$$

$$
	\seq{2,0,1}
$$

$$
	\seq{2,1,0}
$$

</Grid>

If we kept counting the mappings, we'd see the following:

| ${n}$      | number of permutations |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| 0          | 1                      |
| 1          | 1                      |
| 2          | 2                      |
| 3          | 6                      |
| 4          | 24                     |
| 5          | 120                    |
| ${\vdots}$ | ${\vdots}$             |
| 8          | 40320                  |
| 9          | 362880                 |
| ${\vdots}$ | ${\vdots}$             |
| 15         | 1307674368000          |
| ${\vdots}$ | ${\vdots}$             |

The operation of finding the number of permutations of ${\Seq{n},}$ given ${n,}$
is called the _factorial_.

<dfn>

__factorial.__ Let ${n \in \NN.}$ Then ${n!}$ is the number of permutations on
${\Seq{n},}$ where

$$
	n! = 1 \times 2 \times \ldots \times \n
$$

and ${0! = 1.}$

</dfn>

An interesting property of ${n!}$ is just how much faster it grows compared to
${a^n, a \in \RR.}$ For large values of ${n,}$ ${a}$ is going to be somewhere
close to the beginning.

## Young Tableaux

Let's take a brief detour and see an interesting application of what we know so
far. A _Young diagram_, denoted ${\lambda,}$ is a collection of ${\abs{\lambda}
= n}$ boxes which are top- and left-aligned. For example, below, the green
collections are Young diagrams, but the red ones are not:

<Fig
link={"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1663274377/math/young_diagram_ppb2hb.svg"}
imwidth={"291"} imheight={"181"} caption={"Young diagram"} width={"40"} />

Rather than draw the boxes each time, it's common to use the notation ${(x_1,
x_2, \ldots, x_n),}$ where each ${x_i}$ is the number of boxes in each row.
Thus, for the Young diagrams above, we have (mapping from left to right):

<Grid cols={3}>

$$
	(4,2)
$$

$$
	(4,3,2)
$$

$$
	(4,1,1,1)
$$

</Grid>


A _standard Young tableaux_ is a Young diagram ${T}$ with all of the following
properties:

1. Each box is filled with an positive integer ${1,2,3,\ldots,n}$
2. Each integer is used exactly once.
3. The integers increase along the rows, from left to right.
4. The integers increase along the columns, from top to bottom.

For example, the following is a standard Young tableaux:

<Fig
link={"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1663274745/math/young_tableaux_okedi4.svg"}
imwidth={"700"} imheight={"700"} caption={"young tableaux"} width={"15"} />

We denote ${f_{\lambda}}$ as the number of standard Young tableaux of shape
${\lambda.}$ Let's suppose  ${n = 1,}$ we just have:

$$
	f_{(1)} = 1
$$

If ${n = 2,}$ we get:

<Grid cols={2}>

$$
	f_{(1,1)} = 1
$$

$$
	f_{(2)} = 1
$$

</Grid>

If ${n = 3,}$ we get:

<Grid cols={3}>

$$
	f_{(1,1,1)} = 1
$$

$$
	f_{(2,1)} = 2
$$

$$
	f_{(3)} = 1
$$

</Grid>

If ${n = 4,}$ we have:

<Grid cols={5}>

$$
	f_{(1,1,1,1)} = 1
$$

$$
	f_{(2,1,1)} = 3
$$

$$
	f_{(2,2)} = 2
$$

$$
	f_{(3,1)} = 3
$$

$$
	f_{(4)} = 1
$$


</Grid>

Let's see if we can see a pattern:

| ${n}$ | ${f_{\lambda}}$     | sum |
| ----- | ------------------- | --- |
| 1     | ${\set{1}        }$ | 1   |
| 2     | ${\set{1,1}      }$ | 2   |
| 3     | ${\set{1,2,1}    }$ | 4   |
| 4     | ${\set{1,3,2,3,1}}$ | 10  |

It's a bit hard to see if there's something there. What if we sum the squares of
the numbers:

| ${n}$ | ${f_{\lambda}}$     | sum | sum of squares |
| ----- | ------------------- | --- | -------------- |
| 1     | ${\set{1}        }$ | 1   | 1              |
| 2     | ${\set{1,1}      }$ | 2   | 2              |
| 3     | ${\set{1,2,1}    }$ | 4   | 6              |
| 4     | ${\set{1,3,2,3,1}}$ | 10  | 24             |

As it turns out, the sum of the squares is ${n!.}$ This gives us the following:

<dfn>

__theorem.__ Let ${n \in \NN : n \geq 1.}$ Then:

$$
	\sum_{\abs{\lambda} = n} (f_{\lambda})^2 = n!
$$

</dfn>


Is there formula for computing ${f_{\lambda}?}$ Yes:

<dfn>

__hook length formula.__ The number of standard Young tableaux of
shape ${\lambda,}$ denoted ${f_{\lambda,}}$ is given by the formula:


$$
	f_{\lambda} = \dfrac{n!}{\prod_{b \in \lambda} h_{b}}
$$

where ${n}$ is the number of boxes, ${b}$ is a box in the tableaux, and ${h(b)}$
is called a _hook_, defined as:

$$
	h_{\lambda}(B) = \dfrac{\tt{number of boxes east of ${B}$}}{\tt{number of
	boxes south of ${B}$}}
$$

</dfn>

For example, given a Young tableaux of shape ${(2,2),}$ we have ${n = 4.}$
There are only 2 possible standard Young tableaux:

$$
	f_{\lambda} = \dfrac{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4}{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3} = 2
$$

## Binomial Coefficients

Consider the following question:

<dfn>

__question.__ ${n \in \ZZ^+}$ runners participate in a marathon. How many
possible lists of medal winners (gold, silver, bronze) are there? Assume that
there can be no ties (i.e., only one gold medalist, silver, etc.).

</dfn>

We want to think of this question in terms of mapping. Here, we have a mapping
from the set of medals to the set ${n}$ runners. Let's suppose the runners are
numbered from ${0}$ to ${R,}$ where ${R = n.}$ A list of medalists, then, is
defined as:

$$
	f: \set{\tt{gold}, \tt{silver}, \tt{bronze}} \bij R
$$

Our question now becomes: How many possible ${f}$'s are there? Well, since this
is a bijection, when we map one of the medals to one of the ${n}$s, that medal
can no longer be mapped to any of the others. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a
bijection.
