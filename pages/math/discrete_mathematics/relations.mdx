# Relations

<q>
_"Mathematicians study not objects, but relations between objects; the
replacement of these objects by others is therefore indifferent to them,
provided the relations do not change. The matter is for them unimportant,
the form alone interests them."_

Jules Henri Poincare, _Science and Hypothesis_ 44-45 (1952).

The notes below cover relations in mathematics. A **relation** is a
relationship between elements of some set. More formally:

> __definition__. A relation from a set ${A}$ to a set ${B}$ is a subset of
> ${A \times B.}$

From this definition, relations are a special kind of set. They're a set of
pairs ${(a, b),}$ where ${a \in A}$ and ${b \in B.}$ Thus, relations are
more generally just a set of pairs. For example, suppose ${A}$ is the set
of all voters in some district, and ${B}$ is the set of all political
parties:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	A &= \{ a, b, c, d \} \\
	B &= \{ \text{Democrat},~\text{Republican},~\text{Independent}  \}
\end{aligned}
$$

If each voter identifies with one of the parties above, we can map the
voter-party relationships in various ways:

<Grid cols={2}>

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		&(a, \text{Democrat} ) \\
		&(b, \text{Republican} ) \\
		&(c, \text{Independent} ) \\
		&(d, \text{Independent} ) \\
	\end{aligned}
$$

<Bipartite
	data={[
		{ link: ["a", "\\text{Democrat}"] },
		{ link: ["b", "\\text{Republican}"] },
		{ link: ["c", "\\text{Independent}"] },
		{ link: ["d", "\\text{Independent}"] },
	]}
	margins={[0,80,0,0]}
	height={205}
	scale={80}
	id={"party_map"}
/>
</Grid>

Both of the diagrams above visualize a relation between the set of voters
and the set of parties. Following our earlier definition, the relation is a
subset of the cross product of voters and parties. The entire cross product
consists of all the possible combinations of voters to parties:

<CartesianProduct
	cols={4}
	sets={[
		["a", "b", "c", "d"],
		["\\text{Democrat}", "\\text{Republican}", "\\text{Independent}"],
	]}
/>

Let's consider another example. Suppose we had the following set:

$$
	A = \{ a,b,c,d \}
$$

Suppose each member of the set above is some person. Those people might
have relations with one another. Assuming there are such relations, we
might visualize them as follows:

<Graph
	data={[
		{ link: [{ id: "a", dx: 8, dy: 1 }, "b"] },
		{ link: ["b", "a"] },
		{ link: ["c", "d"] },
		{ link: ["c", "a"] },
		{ link: ["c", "c"] },
		{ link: ["d", "d"] },
	]}
	scale={40}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"relation_demo_1"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

Here's another relation:

<Graph
	data={[
		{ link: [3, 12] },
		{ link: [6, 12] },
		{ link: [2, 4] },
		{ link: [4, 12] },
		{ link: [2, 12] },
		{ link: [2, 6] },
		{ link: [3, 6] },
	]}
	scale={30}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"relation_demo_2"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

In the relation above, each number with a a directed edge to another
indicates that the source number divides its target. For example, 2 divides
4, as well as 12 and 6. 3 divides 6 and 12, and 6 divides 12. But 3 does
not divide 2 or 4, and neither do those numbers divide 3.

## Relations on a Single Set

The relations we examined above are examples of **binary relations** —
betweene two sets. A relation, however, can also be defined in terms of a
single set.

> __definition__. A relation on a set ${A}$ is a relation from ${}$ to ${A.}$

For example, say we have the set:

$$
	A = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}
$$

We can define a relation on this set as:

$$
		R = \{ (a,b) : a \space\vert\space b  \}
$$

This yields the set:

$$
	R =
	\left\{
\begin{aligned}
		&(1,1)~(1,2)~(1, 3) \\
		&(1,1)~(1,2)~(2, 2) \\
		&(1,1)~(1,2)~(2, 2) \\
		&(2,4)~(2,6)~(3, 3) \\
		&(3,6)~(4,4)~(5, 5) \\
		&(6,6)
\end{aligned}
	\right\}
$$

since the first element in all the pairs above divides the second element.

### Cardinality of Relations

Let's say we have the following facts:

> A relation on a set ${A}$ is a subset of ${A \times A.}$ Set ${A}$
> contains ${n}$ elements, and set ${A \times A}$ contains ${n^2}$
> elements.

Question: How many possible relations are there on the set ${A}$? This
question boils down to finding that the [power set](set_theory#power-sets)
of ${A \times A.}$ To start, let ${\mathcal{P}(A)}$ be the power set of
${A.}$ Following the [definition of a power set](set_theory#power-sets), it
follows ${\mathcal{P}(A)}$ must have ${2^n}$ elements. Therefore:

$$
	\mathcal{P}(A \times A) = 2^{n^2}
$$

## Properties of Relations

Just as humans have different relationships between one another, there are
different kinds of relations in mathematics. The two broadest categories
are _reflexive relations_ and _irreflexive relations_.

### Reflexive Relations

A reflexive relation is defined as follows:

> __definition__. A relation ${R}$ on a base set ${A}$ is reflexive iff for
> every ${x \in A,}$ ${xRx.}$

In logical notation:

> __definition__.
> ${\text{isReflexive}(R_A) \iff \forall a \in A((a,a) \in R) }$

The notation ${xRx}$ means "${x}$ is related to ${x.}$" Thus, the
definition above provides that a relation ${R}$ is considered reflexive if,
and only if, every ${x}$ in the relation's base set is related to itself. A
more explicit definition:

> __definition__. A relation ${R}$ on a base set ${A}$ is reflexive if, and
> only if, for every element ${a \in A,}$ ${(a,a) \in R.}$

In visual terms, the reflexive relation describes graphs where every node
loops to itself. For example, the graphs below are all examples of
reflexive relations:

<Grid cols={3}>

<Graph
	data={[
		{ link: [2, 6] },
		{ link: [6, 6] },
		{ link: [2, 2] },
		{ link: [3, 6] },
		{ link: [3, 3] },
		{ link: [6, 4] },
		{ link: [4, 4] },
	]}
	scale={70}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"reflexive1"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

<Graph
	data={[
		{ link: [1, 1] },
		{ link: [1, 2] },
		{ link: [2, 2] },
		{ link: [3, 3] },
	]}
	scale={70}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"reflexive2"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

<Graph
	data={[{ link: [1, 1] }, { link: [2, 2] }, { link: [3, 3] }]}
	scale={70}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"reflexive3"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

</Grid>

Note that the definition doesn't mean the dots can't have connections
between one another, nor does it mean that the graphs must have some
connection with another. As long as all of the nodes connect to themselves,
we have a reflexive relation.

### Irreflexive Relations

The irreflexive relation is defined as follows:

> __definition__. A relation ${R}$ on a baset set ${A}$ is irreflexive iff
> for every ${x \in A,}$ ${x\not\mathrel{R}x.}$

In logical notation:

> __definition__.
> ${\text{isIrreflexive}(R_A) \iff \forall a \in A((a,a) \notin R) }$

The notation ${x\not\mathrel{R}x}$ means "𝑥 is not related to 𝑥."
Accordingly, the irreflexive relation describes a graph where not a single
node connects to itself. For example, all of the graphs below are
irreflexive, because there is no node that connects to itself:

<Grid cols={3}>

<Graph
	data={[
		{ link: [2, 3] },
		{ link: [3, 1] },
		{ link: [4, 1] },
		{ link: [{ id: 5, dx: -15, dy: -10 }, 1] },
		{ link: [2, 5] },
	]}
	scale={70}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"irreflexive1"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

<Graph
	data={[
		{ link: [1, 2] },
		{ link: [1, 4] },
		{ link: [1, 3] },
		{ link: [5] },
	]}
	scale={75}
	fontSize={1}
	width={220}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"irreflexive2"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

<Graph
	data={[{ link: [1] }, { link: [2] }, { link: [3] }]}
	scale={70}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"irreflexive3"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

</Grid>

#### Reflexive or Irreflexive?

An all too common mistake is incorrectly classifying a relation as
reflexive or irreflexive when it's neither. Remember, the definitions for
reflexive and irreflexive impose _necessary conditions_. If any of those
conditions aren't satisfied, the definitions don't apply.

For example, consider the relations below:

<Grid cols={3} rows={2} rowgap={30}>

<Graph
	data={[{ link: ["a", "a"] }, { link: ["b", "b"] }]}
	scale={70}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"Graph A"}
	label={"\\text{Relation A}"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

<Graph

		{ link: ["e", "e"] },
		{ link: ["f", "f"] },
		{ link: ["g"] },
		{ link: ["h"] },
	]}

	repulsion={0.15}
	fontSize={1}
	width={220}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"Graph B"}
	label={"\\text{Relation B}"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

<Graph
	data={[{ link: ["x", "y"] }, { link: ["y", "z"] }]}
	scale={70}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"Graph C"}
	label={"\\text{Relation C}"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

<Graph
	data={[
		{ link: ["t", "u"] },
		{ link: ["u", "t"] },
		{ link: ["v", "u"] },
		{ link: ["u", "v"] },
	]}
	scale={70}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"Graph D"}
	label={"\\text{Relation D}"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

<Graph
	data={[
		{ link: ["p", "q"] },
		{ link: ["q", "r"] },
		{ link: ["r", "s"] },
		{ link: ["p", "s"] },
		{ link: ["p", "r"] },
		{ link: ["q", "s"] },
	]}
	straightEdges={true}
	scale={70}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"Graph E"}
	label={"\\text{Relation E}"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

</Grid>

Relation 𝐴 is reflexive because all of the members — 𝑎 and 𝑏 — have loops.
And because all of the base set members have loops, relation 𝐴 cannot be
irreflexive.

Relation 𝐵 is neither reflexive nor irreflexive. The members 𝑓 and 𝑒
contain loops, so the definition of irreflexivity is not satisfied.
Moreover, because members 𝑔 and ℎ do not contain loops, relation 𝐵 also
fails the definition of reflexivity.

Relation 𝐶 is irreflexive, since all of members — 𝑥, 𝑦, and 𝑧 — are devoid
of loops. Because there are no members containing loops, relation 𝐶 is not
a reflexive relation.

Relation 𝐷 is irreflexive, since none of the members relate to themselves.
And like relation 𝐶, because there are no self-relating nodes, relation 𝐷
is not reflexive.

Finally, relation 𝐸 is irreflexive but not reflexive, since 𝐸 contains no
loops.

### Symmetric Relations

A symmetric relation has the following definition:

> __definition__. A relation ${R}$ on a base set ${A}$ is symmetric iff for
> every ${x,y \in A,}$ if ${xRy,}$ then ${yRx.}$

The symmetric relation's name is suggestive: If we take any pair of
elements in the base set, say (𝑥,𝑦), and find that 𝑥 is related to 𝑦, then
that relation is symmetric if and only if 𝑦 is also related to 𝑥.
Informally, this means that "one-way" relations fail this definition.

<Grid cols={3}>

<Graph
	data={[{ link: ["a", "b"] }, { link: ["b", "a"] }]}
	scale={90}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"symm1"}
	label={"\\text{Relation L}"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

<Graph
	data={[{ link: ["h"] }, { link: ["i"] }]}
	scale={90}
	collisionRadius={1}
	repulsion={0.15}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"symm2"}
	label={"\\text{Relation M}"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

<Graph
	data={[{ link: ["x", "y"] }]}
	scale={90}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"symm3"}
	label={"\\text{Relation N}"}
	isDirected={true}
	className={"redGraph"}
/>

</Grid>

Both relations 𝐿 and 𝑁 are symmetric relations. 𝑀, however, is not a
symmetric relation. Another example: siblings are a symmetric relation.
Apollo is Artemis's sibling, and Artemis is Apollo's sibling. Parent-child
relations, however, are not symmetric relations. Leto is Apollo's mother,
but Apollo is not Leto's mother — Apollo is Leto's son.

Another way to illustrate these relations is with a _bipartite graph_. In
the graphs below, the nodes 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑, 𝑒, and 𝑓 are all members of some
set. The nodes 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 from one subset, and the nodes 𝑑, 𝑒, and 𝑓 form
another. Arrow heads on both ends of an edge indicate that the relation
goes both ways, while an arrowhead on just one end indicates that the
relation is one-way. Based on this description, we see that the graphs 𝐴
and 𝐵 are symmetric, but 𝐶 is not.

<Grid cols={3}>

<Bipartite
	data={[
		{ link: ["a", "d"], sym: true },
		{ link: ["a", "e"], sym: true },
		{ link: ["b", "e"], sym: true },
		{ link: ["b", "f"], sym: true },
		{ link: ["c", "f"], sym: true },
	]}
	groups={["x", "y"]}
	id={"bipartite1"}
	label={"A"}
/>

<Bipartite
	data={[
		{ link: ["a", "d"], sym: true },
		{ link: ["b", "f"], sym: true },
		{ link: ["c", "f"], sym: true },
		{ link: ["e"], sym: true },
	]}
	groups={["x", "y"]}
	id={"bipartite2"}
	label={"B"}
/>

<Bipartite
	data={[
		{ link: ["a", "d"] },
		{ link: ["a", "e"] },
		{ link: ["b", "e"] },
		{ link: ["b", "f"] },
		{ link: ["c", "f"] },
	]}
	groups={["x", "y"]}
	id={"bipartite3"}
	label={"C"}
/>

</Grid>

The existence of a loop has no bearing on whether a relation is symmetric.
Since a loop is a relation from a node to itself, it doesn't violate the
one-way prohibition — there's no "way" in the first place.

<Graph
	data={[
		{ link: ["a", "b"] },
		{ link: ["b", "a"] },
		{ link: ["a", "a"] },
		{ link: ["a", "c"] },
		{ link: ["c", "a"] },
		{ link: ["c", "d"] },
		{ link: ["d", "c"] },
		{ link: ["e", "e"] },
	]}
	scale={30}
	fontSize={1}
	width={220}
	noNodeLabels={true}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"symmetric_with_loops"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

### Antisymmetric Relations

The antisymmetric relation is defined as follows:

> __definition__. A relation ${R}$ on a base set ${A}$ is antisymmetric iff
> for every ${x,y \in A,}$ if ${xRy}$ and ${x \neq y,}$ then
> ${y\not\mathrel{R}x.}$

Antisymmetric relations are relations where no two elements in the base set
are related with a two-way relation. For example, in the relations below,
the relations 𝑄 and 𝑅 are antisymmetric, but the relation 𝑃 is not
antisymmetric.

<Grid cols={3}>

<Graph
	data={[{ link: ["a", "b"] }, { link: ["b", "a"] }]}
	scale={90}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"asym1"}
	label={"\\text{Relation P}"}
	isDirected={true}
	className={"redGraph"}
/>

<Graph
	data={[{ link: ["h"] }, { link: ["i"] }]}
	scale={90}
	collisionRadius={1}
	repulsion={0.15}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"asym2"}
	label={"\\text{Relation Q}"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

<Graph
	data={[{ link: ["x", "y"] }]}
	scale={90}
	fontSize={1}
	width={200}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"asym3"}
	label={"\\text{Relation R}"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

</Grid>

Note that an antisymmetric relation does not mean that the relation is not
symmetric. In other words, "antisymmetric" and "symmetric" are not opposite
terms. We can see this is the case with the relations above: 𝑄 is both
symmetric and antisymmetric.

Here's another antisymmetric relation:

<Graph
	data={[
		{ link: ["a", "b"] },
		{ link: ["a", "c"] },
		{ link: ["c", "d"] },
		{ link: ["e", "d"] },
	]}
	scale={30}
	fontSize={1}
	width={220}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"anti_symmetric_relation_1"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

### Transitive Relations

A transitive relation is any relation that satisfies this definition:

> __definition__. A relation ${R}$ on a base set ${A}$ is transitive iff: For
> every ${x,y,z \in A,}$ if ${xRy}$ and ${yRz,}$ then ${xRz.}$

For example, consider the following graph:

<Graph
	data={[
		{ link: ["x", "y"] },
		{ link: ["y", { id: "z", dy: -25 }] },
		{ link: ["x", "z"], class: "dash" },
	]}
	scale={30}
	fontSize={1}
	straightEdges={true}
	width={220}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"transitive_1"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

Above, we see that 𝑥 is related to 𝑦, and 𝑦 is related to 𝑧. Then, we see
that 𝑥 is related to 𝑧. Because we have all three necessary individual
relations, we say that the relation above is transitive. If, instead, the
relation looked like:

<Graph
	data={[{ link: ["x", "y"] }, { link: ["y", { id: "z", dy: -25 }] }]}
	scale={30}
	fontSize={1}
	straightEdges={true}
	width={220}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"transitive_2"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

then the relation would not be transitive. There's no relation between 𝑥
and 𝑧. Illustrating with a human relation example:

> _John likes Ally. Ally likes Sam. John also likes Sam._

Visually, this attraction-relation is:

<Graph
	data={[
		{ link: ["\\text{John}", "\\text{Ally}"] },
		{ link: ["\\text{Ally}", { id: "\\text{Sam}", dy: -22 }] },
		{ link: ["\\text{John}", "\\text{Sam}"] },
	]}
	scale={40}
	fontSize={0.8}
	straightEdges={true}
	width={220}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"johnAllySam"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

We can see that the attraction-relation is transitive. However, if John did
not like Ally, we would not have a transitive relation:

<Graph
	data={[
		{ link: ["\\text{Ally}", { id: "\\text{Sam}", dy: -19, dx: 5 }] },
		{ link: [{ id: "\\text{John}", dx: 5, dy: -2 }, "\\text{Sam}"] },
	]}
	scale={40}
	fontSize={0.8}
	straightEdges={true}
	width={220}
	height={170}
	margins={[20, 20, 20, 20]}
	id={"johnAllySam2"}
	isDirected={true}
/>

## Operations on Relations

Because relations are really just special kinds of sets, we can perform set
operations over them. For example, say we had the following sets:

<Grid cols={2}>

$$
	A = \{ 1,2,3 \}
$$

$$
	B = \{ 3,4,5 \}
$$

</Grid>

And suppose we had the following relations:

<Grid cols={2}>

$$
	R_1 = \{ (1,3), (1,4), (3,3) \}
$$

$$
	B = \{ (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (2,5) \}
$$

</Grid>

The union of these relations is the set containing all of the elements of
${R_1}$ and all the elements of ${R_2}$:

$$
	R_1 \cup R_2 =
	\left\{
		\begin{aligned}
			&(1,3)~(1,4)~(2,3) \\
			&(2,4)~(2,5)~(3,3)
		\end{aligned}
	\right\}
$$

The intersection of ${R_1}$ and ${R_2}$ is the set of all elements common
to both ${R_1}$ and ${R_2}$:

$$
	R_1 \cap R_2 = \{ (3,3) \}
$$

The difference of ${R_1}$ and ${R_2}$ is the set of all elements in ${R_1}$
but not in ${R_2}$:

$$
	R_1 - R_2 = \{ (1,3), (1,4) \}
$$

Likewise, the difference of ${R_2}$ and ${R_1}$ is the set of all elements
in ${R_2}$ but not in ${R_1}$:

$$
	R_2 - R_1 = \{ (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) \}
$$

The symmetric difference of ${R_1}$ and ${R_2}$ is the difference of
${R_1 \cup R_2}$ and ${R_1 \cap R_2}$:

$$
	R_1 \oplus R_2 =
	\left\{
		\begin{aligned}
			&(1,3)~(1,4)~(2,3) \\
			&(2,4)~(2,5)
		\end{aligned}
	\right\}
$$
