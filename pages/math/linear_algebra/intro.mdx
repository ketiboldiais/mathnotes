# Linear Algebra

The following notes cover linear algebra.

>__definition: linear equation.__ An equation of the form:
>
>$$
> a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n = b
>$$
>
>is a _linear equation_ in the variables ${x_1,}$ ${x_2,}$
>${\ldots,}$ ${x_n}$ whre ${a_1,}$ ${a_2,}$ ${\ldots,}$
>${a_n,}$ ${b}$ are constants.

A solution to a linear equation ${a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n = b}$ is
the set of values:

$$
 \set{x_1=c_1, x_2=c_2, \ldots, x_n = c_n}
$$

that, all together, satisfy the linear equation. For example, say we wanted to
solve the equation:

$$
	x_1 + 2x_2 - 3x_3 = = 8
$$

one possible set of solutions is:

$$
	\set{x_1 = -1,~x_2 = 3,~x_3 = -1}
$$

since:

$$
	3 + 2(3) - 3(-1) = 8
$$

Another set of solutions is:

$$
	\set{x_1 = 3,~x_2 = 4,~x_3 = 1}
$$

given that:

$$
	3 + 2(4) - 3(1) = 8
$$

## Augmented Matrices

Given a system of equations:

$$
	\begin{cases}
			\begin{aligned}
				 & a_{11} x_1 +  a_{12} x_2 + \ldots + a_{1n} x_n = b1 \\
				 & a_{21} x_1 +  a_{22} x_2 + \ldots + a_{2n} x_n = b2 \\
				 & \vdots \\
				 & a_{m1} x_1 +  a_{m2} x_2 + \ldots + a_{mn} x_n = b_m
			\end{aligned}
	\end{cases}
$$

we can express this system with an __augmented matrix__:

<BoxMatrix data={[
	["a_{11}", `a_{12}`, `\\ldots`, `a_{1n}`, `|`, `b_1`],
	["a_{21}", `a_{22}`, `\\ldots`, `a_{2n}`, `|`, `b_2`],
	["\\vdots", `\\vdots`, `\\vdots`, `\\vdots`, `|`, `\\vdots`],
	["a_{m1}", `a_{m2}`, `\\ldots`, `a_{mn}`, `|`, `b_m`],
]}/>

## Reduced Row Echelon Form

Consider these matrices:

<Grid cols={3}>

<BoxMatrix data={[
	[1,0,0,3],
	[0,1,0,-4],
	[0,0,1,5],
]}/>

<BoxMatrix data={[
	[1,0,3,0,4],
	[0,0,0,1,5],
	[0,0,0,0,0],
]}/>

<BoxMatrix data={[
	[1,3,0,0,2,-1],
	[0,0,1,0,1,4],
	[0,0,0,1,-1,3],
	[0,0,0,0,0,0],
]}/>

</Grid>

We say that these matrices are in _reduced row echelon form_.

> __definition: reduced row echelon form.__ An augmented matrix is in _reduced
> row echelong form_ if it satisfies the
> following properties:
> 
> 1. Any row containing all zeroes is placed at the bottom.
> 2. For every other row, the first or leading non-zero element is 1.
> 3. If a row contains non-zero elements, then the elements are ordered
> according to the positions of leading 1s.
> 4. Every column containing a leading 1 has zero elsewhere.

## Matrix Algebra

Augmented matrices are an instance of a more general mathematical object called
a __matrix__. A matrix is simply a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows
and columns. The numbers comprised by the matrix are called the matrix's
__elements.__

It's worth familiarizing ourselves with basic matrix terminology.

### Definition: Matrix

A matrix a rectangular array of numbers, consisting of rows and columns:

<BoxMatrix data={[
	["a_{11}", `a_{12}`, `\\ldots`, `a_{1n}`, `|`, `b_1`],
	["a_{21}", `a_{22}`, `\\ldots`, `a_{2n}`, `|`, `b_2`],
	["\\vdots", `\\vdots`, `\\vdots`, `\\vdots`, `|`, `\\vdots`],
	["a_{m1}", `a_{m2}`, `\\ldots`, `a_{mn}`, `|`, `b_m`],
]}/>

where:

$$
		\begin{aligned}
			i &= 1,2,3, \ldots, m   \\
			j &= 1,2,3, \ldots, n  
		\end{aligned}
$$

and ${a_{ij}}$ is the element in the ${i}$th row, ${j}$th column.


### Definition: Matrix order

An ${m \times n}$ matrix consists of ${m}$ rows and ${n}$ columns. The notation
${m \times n}$ is called the matrix's order.




### Definition: Vector

A ${m \times 1}$ matrix is called a _column vector_. A
${1 \times n}$ matrix is called a _row vector_. Both are, in general, referred
to as _vectors_.



### Definition: Square Matrix

A matrix of order ${n \times n}$ (i.e., a matrix with the same number of rows as
columns) is called a _square matrix_.

_Example._

<BoxMatrix data={[
	[1,2,3],
	[2,0,0],
	[3,0,0],
]}/>



### Definition: Zero Matrix

A zero matrix, denoted ${\O,}$ is a matrix where all elements of the matrix are
zero.

_Example._

<BoxMatrix data={[
	[0,0,0,0],
	[0,0,0,0],
	[0,0,0,0],
	[0,0,0,0],
]}/>


### Definition: Main Diagonal

Given a square matrix:

<BoxMatrix data={[
	["\\color{red}a_{11}", `a_{12}`, `a_{13}`, `\\ldots`, `a_{1n}`],
	["a_{21}", `\\color{red}a_{22}`, `a_{23}`, `\\ldots`, `a_{2n}`],
	["a_{31}", `a_{32}`, `\\color{red}a_{33}`, `\\ldots`, `a_{3n}`],
	["\\vdots", `\\vdots`, `\\vdots`, `\\color{red}\\ddots`, `\\vdots`],
	["a_{n1}", `a_{n2}`, `a_{n3}`, `\\ldots`, `\\color{red}a_{nn}`],
]}/>

the elements ${a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33}, \ldots, a_{nn}}$ form the matrix's _main
diagonal_.



### Definition: Identity Matrix

The identity matrix, denoted ${\I,}$ is a square matrix with the following
properties:

1. If a matrix element lies on the matrix's main diagonal, the element is 1.
2. Else, the element is 0.

_Example._

<BoxMatrix data={[
	["\\color{red}1",0,0,0,0],
	[0,"\\color{red}1",0,0,0],
	[0,0,"\\color{red}1",0,0],
	[0,0,0,"\\color{red}1",0],
	[0,0,0,0,"\\color{red}1"],
]}/>




### Definition: Upper Triangular Matrix

An upper triangular matrix ${M}$ is a matrix with the following properties:

1. ${M}$ is a square matrix.
2. If ${i \gtn j,}$ then ${a_{ij} = 0.}$

_Example._

<BoxMatrix data={[
	[1,1,1],
	[`\\color{red}0`,1,1],
	[`\\color{red}0`,`\\color{red}0`,1],
]}/>





### Definition: Lower Triangular Matrix

A lower triangular matrix ${M}$ is a matrix with the following properties:

1. ${M}$ is a square matrix.
2. If ${i \ltn j,}$ then ${a_{ij} = 0 }$

_Example._

<BoxMatrix data={[
	[1,`\\color{red}0`,`\\color{red}0`],
	[1,1,`\\color{red}0`],
	[1,1,1],
]}/>



### Equality of Matrices

Two matrices are equal if they have th same order _and_ the elements in
corresponding positions are equal.

_Example_

<BoxMatrix data={[
	[`a`, `b`],
	[`c`, `d`],
]}/>

is equal to 

<BoxMatrix data={[
	[`w`, `x`],
	[`y`, `z`],
]}/>

if, and only if:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		 a &= w \\
		 b &= x \\
		 c &= y \\
		 d &= z
	\end{aligned}
$$

### Addition of Matrices

Two matrices can be added if, and only if, they are of the same order:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	a & b \\
	c & d
\end{bmatrix}
+ 
\begin{bmatrix}
	w & x \\
	y & z
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
	w+a & b+x \\
	c+y & d+z
\end{bmatrix}
$$

or, in index form:

$$
	\bf{A} + \bf{B} = (a_{ij}) + (b_{ij}) = (a_{ij} + b_{ij})
$$

### Multiples of Matrices

If a matrix ${\bf{A} = (a_{ij})}$ has order ${m \times n,}$ and ${k}$ is a
scalar, then ${k \bf{A} = ka_{ij}.}$ In other words, ${k \bf{A}}$ is what we get
when we multiply each element of ${\bf{A}}$ by the scalar ${k.}$

For example:

$$
	\dfrac{1}{2} 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 3 \\
		 2 \\
		 1
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot 3 \\[1em]
		 \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \\[1em]
		 \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot 1
	\end{bmatrix}
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 \dfrac{3}{2} \\[1em]
		 1 \\
		 3
	\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Negative Matrices

Given a matrix ${\bf{A},}$ its negative ${-\bf{A}}$ is simply:

$$
	-1 \cdot \bf{A}
$$

For example, if:

$$
	\bf{A} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		3 & -1 \\
		2 & 4
	\end{bmatrix}
$$

then ${- \bf{A}}$ is:

$$
	-\bf{A} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		-3 & 1 \\ 
		-2 & 4
	\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Matrix Subtraction

To subtract matrices, they must be of the same order, and elements are
subtracted in correspondence.

$$
	\bf{A} - \bf{B} = (a_{ij} - b_{ij})
$$

## Matrix Multiplication 

The previous definitions indicated the similarities between matrix algebra and
elementary algebra. Where the two depart is multiplication of the same type.
With real numbers, multiplication is repeated addition: 

$$
	3 \times 3 = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 
$$

This isn't exactly the case with matrix multiplication. To illustrate, we
consider a real world problem.

Blackacre, a technology company, needs a law firm for an upcoming acquisition.
Specifically, the company needs a team of attorneys in the following practice
areas: trademark law, tax law, and patent law. Of these three areas, the firm
needs 2 trademark lawyers, 8 tax layers, and 2 patent lawyers.  Two law firms
have submitted bids with the following hourly rates for each lawyer:

|                   | Law Firm A       | Law Firm B       |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| trademark lawyers | ${\cash 592.33}$ | ${\cash 585.50}$ |
| tax lawyers       | ${\cash 601.85}$ | ${\cash 601.25}$ |
| patent lawyers    | ${\cash 630.21}$ | ${\cash 632.24}$ |

Which law firm should Blackacre go with? Well, a good start is to compare the
total hourly rate. To do that, we must multiply the number of attorneys with
their respective hourly rates.

For law firm A, we have:

$$
	(2 \times 592.33) + (8 \times 601.85) + (2 \times 630.21) \\
	1184.66 + 4870.80 + 1260.42 = 7315.88
$$

And for law firm B, we have:

$$
	(2 \times 585.50) + (8 \times 601.25) + (2 \times 632.24) \\
	1171.10 + 4890.00 + 1264.48 = 7325.58
$$

Thus, it appears that law firm B is more expensive, by total hourly rate. The
same calculations above can be rewritten in matrix notation:

$$
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 2 & 8 & 2
	\end{bmatrix}
	\times
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 592.33 & 585.50 \\
		 601.85 & 601.25 \\
		 630.21 & 632.24
	\end{bmatrix}
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 7315.88 & 7325.58
	\end{bmatrix}
$$

Notice the pattern:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		 
	
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 2 & 8 & 2
	\end{bmatrix}
	\times
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 592.33 & 585.50 \\
		 601.85 & 601.25 \\
		 630.21 & 632.24
	\end{bmatrix}
	&= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 2(592.33) & 2(585.50) \\
		 8(601.85) & 8(601.25) \\
		 2(630.21) & 2(632.24)
	\end{bmatrix}
	\\[2em]
	&=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 \bnote{7315.88}{row $\times$ column 1} & \bnote{7325.58}{row $\times$
		 column 2}
	\end{bmatrix}

	\end{aligned}
$$

Considering these costs, Blackacre asks their general counsel about whether some
of the matters could be handled by trademark lawyers rather than a tax lawyer.
After reviewing the issues, general counsel informs them that they can get by
with: That is: 3 trademark lawyers, 4 tax lawyers, and 1 patent lawyer.
Consequently, for law firm A, we have a total hourly cost of:

$$
	1776.99 + 2407.40 + 630.21 = 4816.63
$$

and for law firm B, we have:

$$
	1756.50 + 2405.00 + 632.24 = 4794.74
$$

Both of these computations can be expressed as:

$$
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 2 & 8 & 2 \\
		 3 & 4 & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
	\times
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 592.33 & 585.50 \\
		 601.85 & 601.25 \\
		 630.21 & 632.24
	\end{bmatrix}
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 7315.88 & 7325.58 \\
		 4816.63 & 4795.74
	\end{bmatrix}
$$

Notice the how matrix multiplication makes the computation highly-readable and
compact. With the arrangement of 2 trademark lawyers, 8 tax layers, and 2 patent
lawyers, law firm A has a cheaper total hourly rate. But with an arrangement of
3 trademark lawyers, 4 tax lawyers, and 1 patent lawyer, law firm B has a far
cheaper total hourly rate.[^note_salary]

[^note_salary]: As an aside, the hourly rates used in the example are not at all
unusual in the legal industry. Big law firm professionals are among the
highest-paid professionals. Though, the author admits that he may be slighly
biased towards tax and patent attorneys in setting the numbers up, as these were
his focus areas in law school.

Once again, notice the pattern:

$$
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 2 & 8 & 2 \\
		 3 & 4 & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
	\times
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 592.33 & 585.50 \\
		 601.85 & 601.25 \\
		 630.21 & 632.24
	\end{bmatrix}
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		 \tnote{7315.88}{row 1 $\times$ col 1} & \tnote{7325.58}{row 1 $\times$ col 2} \\
		 \bnote{4816.63}{row 2 $\times$ col 1} & \bnote{4795.74}{row 2 $\times$ col 2}
	\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Definition: Matrix Product

Let ${\bf{A}}$ be an ${n \times m}$ matrix and ${\bf{B}}$ an ${m \times p}$
matrix. Then the matrix ${\bf{AB}}$ is an ${m \times p}$ matrix where the
element in the ${r}$th row and the ${c}$th column is the sum of the products of
the elements in the ${r}$th row of ${\bf{A}}$ with the corresponding elements in
the ${c}$th row of ${\bf{B}.}$

That is:

$$
	\bf{AB} = c_{ij} \dsum{r=1}{n} a_{ir} b_{ir} = a_{i1} b_{1j} + a_{i2} b_{2j} +
	a_{i3} b_{3j} + \ldots + a_{in} b_{nj}
$$

where ${i = 1,2,3,\ldots,m}$ and ${j = 1,2,3,\ldots,p.}$

Here's another example:

$$
	\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 2 & 3 \\
		4 & 5 & 6
	\end{bmatrix}
	\times
	\begin{bmatrix}
		7 & 8 \\
		9 & 10 \\
		11 & 12
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		58 & 64 \\
		139 & 154
	\end{bmatrix}
$$

Visually:

	imwidth={"401"}
	imheight={"761"}
	caption={"matrix multiply"}
	width={"40"}
/>

Notationally:

If:

$$
	\bf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
		 a & b \\
		 c & d
	\end{bmatrix}~~~
	\bf{B} = \begin{bmatrix}
		 p & q \\
		 r & s
	\end{bmatrix}
$$

then:

$$
	\bf{AB} = \begin{bmatrix}
		 ap + br & aq + bs \\
		 cp + dr & cq + ds
	\end{bmatrix}
$$

A few things to note about the matrix product.  First, the result of a matrix
product is a square matrix. That is, given a matrix ${\bf{A}}$ of order ${n
\times m}$ and a matrix ${\bf{B}}$ of order ${m \times n,}$ the matrix product
${\bf{AB}}$ is of order ${n \times n.}$

Second, the matrix product ${\bf{AB}}$ exists _only if_ the number of columns of
${\bf{A}}$ equals the number of columns of ${\bf{B}.}$ Without this equality,
the product ${\bf{AB}}$ _cannot be found_. In fact, this condition is so
critical that we introduce an particular notion for it.

### Matrix Productability

Let ${\bf{A}}$ and ${\bf{B}}$ be matrices. We say that ${\bf{A}}$ and ${\bf{B}}$
are _productable_ if, and only if, the number of rows in ${\bf{A}}$ is equal
to the number of columns in ${\bf{B}.}$ If ${\bf{A}}$ and ${\bf{B}}$ are
productable, we write:

$$
	(\mtx{A}, \mtx{B}) \in M_{\times}
$$

where ${M_p}$ is the set of all tuples ${(a,b),}$ such that ${a}$ and ${b}$ are
productable matrices.

## Elementary Algebra v. Matrix Algebra 

At this point, it's helpful to compare and contrast the laws of
element algebra against those of matrix algebra:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Elementary Algebra</th>
			<th>Matrix Algebra</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>If ${a,b \in \RR,}$ then ${a + b \in \RR.}$</td>

		<tr>
			<td>${a(bc) = (ab)c}$ for all ${a,b,c \in \RR.}$</td>
			<td>${(\mtx{A}\mtx{B})\mtx{C} = \mtx{A}(\mtx{B}\mtx{C})}$ provided that ${\mtx{A}, \mtx{B}, \mtx{C} \in M_{\times}.}$</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table> 

## Matrix Transpose

Let ${\mtx{A}}$ be a matrix. Then ${\mtx{A}^{\T}}$ is called the _transpose_ of
${\mtx{A},}$ obtained by writing the rows of ${\mtx{A}}$ as the columns of
${\mtx{A}^{\T}.}$ If ${\mtx{A} = (a_{ij})}$ is an ${m \times n}$ matrix, then
${\mtx{A}^{\T} = (a_{ji})}$ is an ${n \times m}$ matrix.

For example, if:

$$
	\mtx{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
		 2 & 1 & 4 \\
		 0 & 3 & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
$$

then:

$$
	\mtx{A}^{\T} = \begin{bmatrix}
		 2 & 0 \\
		 1 & 3 \\
		 4 & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
$$
