Before we continue with matrices, we take a brief detour to examine vectors.
First, we define two kinds of vectors. The column vector:

<dfn>

__column vector.__ An ${n}$-dimensional column vector ${v}$ is an ${n}$-tuple on ${\reals^n,}$ denoted:

$$
	v_c = \mx{c_1, \\ c_2, \\ \vdots \\ c_n}
$$

where ${c_i \in \reals,~i=1,2,\ldots,n \in \NN}$ are called the _components_ of
the vector ${v.}$

</dfn>

and the row vector:

<dfn>

__row vector.__ An ${n}$-dimensional row vector ${v_r}$ is an ${n}$-tuple on ${\reals^n,}$ denoted:

$$
	v_r = [r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n]
$$

where ${r_i \in \reals,~i=1,2,\ldots,n \in \NN}$ are called the _components_ of the vector ${v.}$

</dfn>

Notice that from the definitions above, both ${n}$-dimensional column vectors
and ${n}$-dimensional row vectors are simply elements of the Cartesian product
${\reals^n.}$ Thus, we write ${v_c \in \reals^n}$ to denote an ${n}$-dimensional
column vector, and ${v_r \in \reals^n}$ to denote an ${n}$-dimensional row
vector. For the remaining sections, we'll restrict ourselves to column vectors.
Thus, when we use the word "vector" we mean a column vector, and when we write
${v \in \reals^n,}$ we mean ${v_c \in \reals^n.}$ When we need to use a row
vector, we revert and use the more explicit notations ${v_r}$ and ${v_c.}$

## Vector Operations

Vectors may be added, subtracted, and multiplied, subject to a few key rules.
We examine these rules below.

### Vector Addition and Subtraction

Given a vector ${v_1 \in \reals^n}$ and a vector ${v_2 \in \reals^n,}$ we can
add the two vectors to obtain the sum ${v_1 + v_2 \in \reals^n.}$ It's important
to note that both ${v_1}$ and ${v_2}$ are both vectors of ${\reals^n.}$ That is,
we can't add a vector ${v_1 \in \reals^2}$ with a vector ${v_2 \in \reals^3.}$

<dfn>

__vector addition.__ Let ${{\mtx{v}} \in \reals^n}$ and ${\mtx{w} \in \reals^n}$ be the vectors

$$
	\mtx{v} = \mx{a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n},~~~
	\mtx{w} = \mx{b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_n}.
$$

where ${a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \in \reals}$ and ${b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \in \reals.}$ Then the vector ${\mtx{v} + \mtx{w} \in \reals^n}$ is the vector sum of ${\mtx{v}}$ and ${\mtx{w},}$ defined as:

$$
	\mtx{c} = \mx{a_1 + b_1 \\ a_2 + b_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n + b_n}.
$$

</dfn>

Below are some examples.

<Grid cols={3}>

$$
	\small
	\mx{0 \\ 5 \\ 9 \\ 2} + \mx{4 \\ 3 \\ 0 \\ 1} = \mx{4 \\ 8 \\ 9 \\ 3}
$$

$$
	\small
	\mx{1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1} + \mx{2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 6} = \mx{3 \\ 4 \\ 5 \\ 7}
$$

$$
	\small
	\mx{1 \\ 3} + \mx{4 \\ 7} = \mx{5 \\ 10}
$$

</Grid>


Note that since each component of a ${v \in \reals^n}$ is a real number, vector
subtraction is also defined.

<Grid cols={2}>

$$
	\small
	\mx{5 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 2} - \mx{1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1} = \mx{4 \\ 2 \\ 3 \\ 1}
$$

$$
	\small
	\mx{5 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 2} + \mx{-1 \\ -1 \\ -1 \\ -1} = \mx{4 \\ 2 \\ 3 \\ 1}
$$

</Grid>

### Scalar Multiplication

Given a vector ${\mtx{v} \in \reals^n,}$ we can multiply ${\mtx{v}}$ with a real
number ${a \in \reals^n.}$ This is called _scalar multiplication_ (we _scale_
the vector).

<dfn>

__scalar multiplication.__ Let ${\mtx{v} \in \reals^n}$ be the vector:

$$
	\mtx{v} = \mx{a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \ldots \\ a_n},
$$

where ${a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n.}$ Given ${c \in \reals,}$ the vector ${c
\mtx{v}}$ is the _scalar product_ of ${c}$ and ${\mtx{v},}$ defined as:

$$
	c \mtx{v} = \mx{ca_1 \\ ca_2 \\ \ldots \\ ca_n}.
$$


</dfn>

### Vector Length

Vectors in ${\reals^n}$ are said to have lengths. This results from the
geometric interpretation of vectors. For example, consider the vector
${\mtx{v},}$ denoted below.

<Fig

imwidth={"713"} imheight={"554"} caption={"vector length"} width={"40"} />

The length of this vector is computed using Pythagoras's theorem:

$$
	\abs{\mtx{v}} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
$$

We denote the length of a vector with vertical bars. This corresponds to the
fact that the length of a vector is interpreted as its _magnitude_.

<dfn>

__vector length.__ Let ${\mtx{v} \in \reals^n}$ be the vector:

$$
	\mtx{v} = \mx{a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \ldots \\ a_n},
$$

where ${a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n.}$ Then the length of ${\mtx{v},}$ denoted ${\abs{\mtx{v}},}$ is defined as:

$$
	\abs{\mtx{v}} = \sqrt{{a_1}^2 + {a_2}^2 + \ldots + {a_n}^2}.
$$


</dfn>

### Vector Relations

Alongside the usual operations, we may also describe relations between vectors.
These relations are defined below.

<dfn>

__vector relations.__ Let ${{\mtx{v}} \in \reals^n}$ and ${\mtx{w} \in \reals^n}$ be the vectors

$$
	\mtx{v} = \mx{a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n},~~~
	\mtx{w} = \mx{b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_n}.
$$

where ${a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \in \reals}$ and ${b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \in \reals.}$ Then ${\mtx{v} \rel \mtx{w}}$ if, and only if,

$$
	a_1 \rel b_1,~~a_2 \rel b_2,~~\ldots,~~a_n \rel b_n,
$$

where ${R \in \set{ =, \le, \ge, \lt, \gt }.}$ That is, ${\mtx{v} \rel \mtx{w},}$ if and only if ${R}$ holds for all members of the Cartesian product of the components of ${\mtx{v}}$ and ${\mtx{w}.}$

</dfn>

## Linear Combinations

While linear algebra is most often associated with matrices, the field is
equally concerned with vectors (vectors are, after all, matrices). A central
question in linear algebra is whether we can solve for an unknown vector given a
vector equation involving the unknown. For example, suppose we're given the
equation:

$$
	x_1 \mx{4 \\ -8 \\ 3} + x_2 \mx{-2 \\ 9 \\ 4} = \mx{14 \\ 43 \\ 6}.
$$

We can also express this equation as:

$$
		x_1 \mtx{v_1} + x_2 \mtx{v_2} = \mtx{b}
$$

where ${\mtx{v_1}}$ and ${\mtx{v_2}}$ correspond to the vectors expressed
earlier. Now suppose we're asked to solve find values for ${x_1}$ and ${x_2}$ —
scalar values — such that the equation holds. Given what we know about vector
operations, this problem turns into a system of linear equations.

<div className="eq">

| ${4x_1}$  | ${+}$ | ${-2x_2}$ | ${=}$ | ${14}$ |
| --------- | ----- | --------- | ----- | ------ |
| ${-8x_1}$ | ${+}$ | ${9x_2}$  | ${=}$ | ${43}$ |
| ${3x_1}$  | ${+}$ | ${4x_2}$  | ${=}$ | ${6}$  |

</div>

Which, as we've seen, can be expressed as a matrix:

<div className="aug">

| ${4}$  | ${-2}$ | ${14}$ |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| ${-8}$ | ${9}$  | ${43}$ |
| ${3}$  | ${4}$  | ${6}$  |

</div>

For this particular equation, we get ${x_1 = -2}$ and ${x_2 = 3.}$ Since there
are values for which the equation holds, we can think of ${\mtx{b}}$ as a
_linear combination_ of ${\mtx{v_1}}$ and ${\mtx{v_2}.}$ That is, ${\mtx{b}}$
results from combining the components of ${\mtx{v_1}}$ and ${\mtx{v_2}}$ in some
linear way(s). One such way is to multiply ${\mtx{v_1}}$ by ${-2,}$ and
${\mtx{v_2}}$ by ${3.}$

<dfn>

__linear combination.__ Let ${\mtx{v}_1, \mtx{v}_2, \ldots, \mtx{v}_n}$ be
vectors in ${\reals^n.}$ A vector ${\mtx{b}}$ is a _linear combination_ of the
vectors ${\mtx{v}_1, \mtx{v}_2, \ldots, \mtx{v}_n}$ if, and only if, there exists scalars ${x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \in \reals}$ such that:

$$
	x_1 \mtx{v}_1 + x_2 \mtx{v}_2 + \ldots + x_n \mtx{v}_n = \mtx{b}.
$$

</dfn>

Each of scalar in a linear combination is called a _coefficient_ of the linear
combination. These cofficients directly lead to a fundamental problem in linear
algebra called the _linear combination problem_:

> Given vectors ${\mtx{v}_1, \mtx{v}_2, \ldots, \mtx{v}_n}$ and a vector ${b,}$ is ${b}$ a linear combination of ${\mtx{v}_1, \mtx{v}_2, \ldots, \mtx{v}_n?}$
