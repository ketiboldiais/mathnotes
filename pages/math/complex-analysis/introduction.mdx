# Introduction to Complex Analysis

This chapter covers notes on complex analysis.

## Constructing the Complex Numbers

## Preliminary Definitions

Here is our working definition of a complex number:

<dfn>

__complex numbers.__ The set of complex numbers ${\Complex}$ is the set

$$
	\Complex = \set{(a,b) \mid a,b \in \reals}.
$$

Given a complex number ${c = (a,b)}$ we say that ${a}$ is the _real component_ of ${c,}$ denoted ${\text{Re}(c)= a,}$ and that ${b}$ is the _complex component_ of ${c,}$ denoted ${\text{Im}(c) = b.}$ We may express a complex number ${(a,b) \in \Complex,}$ with the notation ${a + bi \in \Complex.}$

</dfn>

<dfn>

__imaginary unit.__ The tuple ${i = (0,1)}$ is called the _imaginary unit._

</dfn>

## Complex Arithmetic

Addition and subtraction of complex numbers is simply component addition and subtraction.

<dfn>

__definition.__ Given ${(a,b), (c,d) \in \Complex,}$ the following operations are are defined:

$$
	\eqs{
		&(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i  &~~~~~~~ \text{addition}\\
		&(a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i  &~~~~~~~ \text{subtraction}\\ 
		&(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i &~~~~~~~ \text{multiplication}\\
		&(a + bi)/(c + di) = \dfrac{(a+bi)(c-di)}{(c+di)(c-di)} &~~~~~~~ \text{division}
	}
$$

where ${a,b,c,d \in \reals.}$

</dfn>

<dfn>

__properties of complex arithmetic.__ Let ${\alpha, \beta \in \Complex.}$ Then the following properties hold:

1. ${\alpha + \beta = \beta + \alpha}$ for all ${\alpha, \beta \in \Complex.}$
2. ${\alpha\beta = \beta\alpha}$ for all ${\alpha, \beta \in \Complex.}$
3. ${(\alpha + \beta) + \lambda = \alpha + (\beta + \lambda)}$ for all ${\alpha, \beta, \lambda \in \Complex.}$
4. ${(\alpha\beta)\lambda = \alpha(\beta\lambda)}$ for all ${\alpha, \beta, \lambda \in \Complex.}$
5. ${\lambda + 0 = \lambda}$ for all ${\lambda \in \Complex.}$
6. ${\lambda \by 1 = \lambda}$ for all ${\lambda \in \Complex.}$
7. For all ${\alpha \in \Complex,}$ there exists a unique ${\beta \in \Complex}$ such that ${\alpha\beta = 1.}$
8. ${\lambda (\alpha + \beta)= \lambda\alpha + \lambda\beta}$ for all ${\alpha, \beta, \lambda \in \Complex.}$
