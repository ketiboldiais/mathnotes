## Objects and Collections 

Recall that we defined a _set_ as follows:

<dfn>

__set.__ A _set_ is a collection of objects, where each object in the set is
called a _member_ or _element_ of the set. If an object ${x}$ is an element of
the set ${X,}$ we write:

$$
	x \in X
$$

</dfn>

Generally, the word _object_ refers to some mathematical object. E.g., the
number ${1}$ or ${\pi.}$ We can think of a _collection_ of these objects as
essentially a pile of the objects; a box where we place all of the objects.

Collections, as we can likely tell by now, are also _objects_. This leads to a
few big problems. Let's examine some of them.

## Russell's Paradox

The first big problem is _Russell's paradox_, named after the British
philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872-1970). When Russell first heard of Cantor's
notion of sets, he joined an ambitious project to ground all of mathematics in
set theory. To Russell, and many other logicians, it seemed as if set theory
is what would ground all of mathematics. For example, the equation:

$$
	x + 1 = 0
$$

is just another way of expressing the set:

$$
	\set{x \in \reals : x = -1}
$$

or simply:

$$
	\set{-1}
$$

Likewise, the statement:

> ${x}$ is a natural number between 0 and 3, inclusive.

Could be expressed as:

$$
	\set{x \in \nat: 0 \leq x \leq 3}
$$

or simply:

$$
	\set{0,1,2,3}
$$

Thus, it seemd as if we could describe any object in mathematics in the form:

$$
	\set{\sf{x}:\sf{x}\text{ has property }\sf{P}}
$$

or, more concisely:

$$
	\set{\sf{x} : \sf{P(x)}}
$$

At some point, however, Russell ran into a problem: Sets are also objects.
This means that given a set ${X,}$ there's nothing stopping ${X}$ from being a
member of itself:

$$
	X = \set{X : \text{${X}$ is a set and ${X}$ has at least one element}}
$$

Staring at this statement, Russell defined another set (called _Russell's set_):

<dfn>

__russell's set.__ Russell's set ${\Rr}$ is defined as the set

$$
	\Rr = \set{\Rr : \text{${\Rr}$ is a set and ${\Rr}$ is not an element of
	itself}}.
$$

</dfn>



Russell then asked a question: Is ${\Rr}$ an element of itself? Well, there are
two cases: (1) Either ${\Rr}$ is an element of itself, or (2) ${\Rr}$ is not an
element of itself. Let's consider these two cases.

__Case (1).__ If ${\Rr}$ is an element of itself, then ${\Rr}$ is in ${\Rr}.$
But that can't be true, because ${\Rr}$ is not an element of itself by
definition.  So, case 2 has to be true. Let's look at that case.

__Case (2).__ If ${\Rr}$ is not an element of itself, then great! We satisfy the
definition. But there's a problem. Because of set theory's axiom of extension,
the set ${\Rr}$ is, by definition, the set of all elements that are:

1. sets, and
2. not elements of themselves.

And since ${\Rr}$ is a set, and not an element of itself, it must be a member of
${\Rr.}$ Which means that ${\Rr}$ is an element itself ... Wait, we just said
that's false! This conundrum is called _Russell's paradox_.

<dfn>

__russell's paradox.__ Let ${x}$ be a set. Then:

$$
	x \in x \iff x \notin x
$$

</dfn>

## Classes

What Russell's paradox demonstrates the following conclusion:

> All sets are collections, but not all collections are sets. 

One such set is Russell's set ${\Rr.}$ Because of these sets, the set theorists
introduced a new kind of collection, called the _class_.

<dfn>

__class.__ A _class_ is a collection of sets, where each set can be described in
a given language.

</dfn>

For now, we'll simply think of classes as collections of sets (not that the word
_collection_ is very important â€” we can't define it as a "set of sets"). We'll
also adopt the convention that all sets are classes (but not all classes are
sets). Thus, whenever we use the word class, we mean a collection of sets.
