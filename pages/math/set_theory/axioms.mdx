There are two versions of set theory: (1) __naive set theory__, and (2)
__axiomatic set theory__. We explore aspects of both theories in the
materials that follow. What are the differences? Naive set theory is the
version of set theory as originally constructed by the German mathematician
Georg Cantor.[^cantor_note] Axiomatic set theory is the version of set
theory constructed in response to several paradoxes, the most famous of
which is _Russell's Paradox_. In this chapter, we focus only on naive set
theory.

[^cantor_note]:
    When Cantor first introduced set theory, the math community largely
    ridiculed him. Over time, however, the theory gained big-name
    mathematicians like David Hilbert. Nevertheless, the ridicule remained
    and affected Cantor deeply. Comments at the time captured the split:
    David Hilbert famously said, "No one will drive us from the paradise
    which Cantor created for us." To which Wittgenstein&mdash;a philosopher
    and one of Hilbert's most formidable opponents&mdash;responded, "If one
    person can see it as a paradise of mathematicians, why should not
    another see it as a joke?"

## Foundational Axioms

In mathematics, a __set__ is a collection of objects. Those objects might
be dogs, people, trees, numbers, values, variables, or more abstractly,
propositions. For example, the set of all coins includes nickels, sterling,
and yen. The set of all countries includes Japan, Palau, and Uruguay. The
set of all integers includes 1 and -117. We can visualize a set as:

<Fig link={
"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653358194/math/set_intro_hky0d0.svg"
} caption={"Basic sets"} width={"30"} imwidth={"239"} imheight={"96"} />

Sets can be finite (there are only so many countries), or infinite (there
are infinitely many of numbers). Each object in a set is called a
_member_ of that set.

### Axiom of Extension

The set $\{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ is the same as the set $\{ 2, 1, 3 \}$, and the same set
as $\{ 2, 2, 3, 1 \}$. We can draw this conclusion because of the _axiom of
extension_.

<dfn>

__axiom of extension.__ Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same
elements.

</dfn>

In short, the _axiom of extension_ provides that a set is completely determined
by what its elements are—it is irrelevant whether the elements are in order, or
whether an element is listed more than once.

### Axiom of Specification

The axiom of specification, also referred to as _Aussonderungsaxiom_, provides
the following:

<dfn>

__axiom of specification.__ To every set ${A}$ and to every condition ${S(x),}$
there exists a set ${B}$ whose elements are exactly the elements ${x}$ of ${A,}$
for which ${S(x)}$ holds.

</dfn>

Set theorists introduced the axiom of specification to get around some awkward
gaps philosophers noticed in the early 1900s. One such gap is Russell's Paradox,
discussed in a separate chapter. In essence, without the axiom of specification,
we get the conclusion that _nothing contains everything_.

While we could simply accept this as a Kōan, it causes enough discomfort to
warrant an axiom. The axiom of specification, in short, establishes that there
exists a set we can specify (e.g., tailor) to a set we desire.

A set that's "tailored" is said to be _well-defined_. We say that a set is
well-defined if, for any given ${x,}$ we can determine whether ${x}$ is a member
of the set. For example, the set ${L = \{x \in \RR \mid x > 4\}}$ is a
well-defined set. Given any ${x,}$ we can determine whether ${x}$ is a member of
${L.}$ ${x}$ must be a real number, and it must be greater than 4.  The set ${G
= \{ 1, 4, 3, 9, \pi, \ldots \},}$ however, is not a well-defined set. Is
${3.2}$ a member of ${G?}$ We do not have enough conditions to make a
determination.

### Axiom of Infinity

We state the axiom of infinity as follows:

<dfn>

__axiom of infinity.__ There exists a set containing ${0}$ and containing the
successor of each of its elements.

</dfn>

The _axiom of infinity_ provides that there is _at least one_ infinite set. This
may not seem important or interesting at this point, but it proves to be
extremely useful at a later juncture. Of note, the axiom of infinity is an issue
in mathematics subject to debate. The hot button is whether the
axiom of infinity is necessary.

## Set Notation

To help make our future discussions more efficient, let's agree on some basic
notation and terminology. First, the notion of logical identity.

<dfn>

__logic identity__. The expression

$$
  \large a = b
$$

means: ${a}$ and ${b}$ are symbols for the same object. If ${a}$ and ${b}$ are
different objects, we write:

$$
  \large a \neq b
$$

</dfn>

Sets can be expressed in a variety of ways:

- "The set of all integers whose square is between, and includes, one and
  nine."
- ${A = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : x^2 \leq 9 \}}$
- ${B = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : \lvert x \rvert \leq 3 \}}$
- ${C = \{ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \}}$

Let's go over these approaches. We denote the notion of set membership with the
symbol ${\in.}$ This is a variant of the lowercase epsilon (${\epsilon}$), which
is the first letter of the Greek word ${ἐστί,}$ meaning "is."

<dfn>

__set membership__. Let ${A}$ be a set. The notation

$$
  a \in A
$$

means: ${a}$ _is_ an element of ${A.}$ If ${a}$ _is not_ an element of ${A,}$ we
write:

$$
  a \notin A
$$

</dfn>

A set may be made more explicit through __set roster notation__. For
instance, $\{ 0, 1, 2 \}$ is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2. If
the set has too many elements to list, ellipses may be used. For example,
the set of all integers from 0 to 100 may be written as:
$\{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots , 100 \}$. Likewise, the set of all positive integers
may be written as $\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$.

We can also specify sets in __set builder notation__. Suppose that $S$ is a
set, and $P(x)$ is a property that elements of $S$ may or may not satisfy.
We can define a new set that contains all the elements of $S$ such that
$P(x)$ is true:

$$
 \{ x \in S \mid P(x) \}
$$

The pipe character, |, is shorthand for "such that." Thus, above notation
refers to all the elements of ${S}$ with the property $P(x)$. Note that in
some mathematical contexts, the phrase "such that" is often abbreviated
"s.t." or $\ni$. Thus, the above set may appear in some texts as:

$$
 \{ x \in S \ni P(x) \}, \space \text{or} \\[1em] \{ x \in S \text{ s.t. } P(x)
 \}
$$

## Subsets

Some sets are themselves elements of another set. These sets are called
__subsets__.[^subsets_note] For example, the set of all Herefords is a
subset of the set of all cows, and the set of all bonobos is a subset of
the set of all great apes. More formally:

[^subsets_note]:
    A set consisting of only one member is called a __singleton__.


<dfn>

__subset__. Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ are sets. The set ${A}$ is a
_subset_ of ${B}$ if, and only if, _every_ element of ${A}$ is also an
element of ${B.}$ To denote this relationship, we write:

$$
  A \subseteq B
$$

If $A$ is not a subset of $B$, then we write:

$$
  A \nsubseteq B
$$


</dfn>



If ${A \subseteq B}$ is true, then we can infer: For every element ${x,}$
if ${x \in A,}$ then ${x \in B.}$ We describe ${A}$ and ${B's}$
relationship with statements such as "${A}$ is contained in $B$" and "${B}$
contains ${A.}$"

$$
  A \subseteq B \iff \forall x(x \in A \implies x \in B)
$$

If $A \nsubseteq B$ is true, then we can infer: There is at least one
element $x$ such that $x \in A$ and $x \notin B$. In other words, if $A$ is
not a subset of $B$, then there is at least one element in $A$ that is not
an element of ${B.}$

From the definition above, if we are asked to prove that ${A}$ is a subset
of ${B,}$ we must show that if ${x}$ belongs to ${A,}$ then ${x}$ also
belongs to ${B.}$ If we are asked to prove that ${A}$ is _not_ a subset of
${B,}$ we must find a single ${x}$ that belongs to ${A}$ but does not
belong to ${B.}$

The definition above implies that the empty set is a subset of all sets,
and a given set is a subset of itself. In other words, for the set ${A,}$
the sets ${\varnothing}$ and ${A}$ are subsets of ${A.}$ We say that ${A}$
and ${\varnothing}$ are __trivial subsets__ of ${A.}$

This follows directly from the definition. The proposition
${\varnothing \subseteq A}$ if, for all ${x \in \varnothing,}$ ${x \in A.}$
Because the sufficient condition, ${x \in \varnothing}$ is false, it
follows that ${x \in A}$ is true. This is an example of a **vacuous
proof**.

The case of ${A \subseteq A}$ straightforward. Given that ${A}$ and ${A}$
are the same sets, every ${x \in A}$ implies that ${x \in A.}$ Because the
sufficient condition is true and the necessary condition is true, it
follows that ${A \subseteq A}$ by definition.

### Proper Subsets

If a subset ${B}$ of ${A}$ is such that ${B \neq A}$ and
${B \neq \varnothing,}$ then we say that ${B}$ is called a proper subset of
${A.}$ For example, the set of all potatoes is a subset of all root
vegetables. It certainly isn't empty—you've got Yukon Golds, Russet
potatoes, Japanese sweet potatoes, LaRette potatoes, and so on. But it also
doesn't comprise the entire set of all root vegetables either, because
there are other root vegetables: taro, yams, tapioca, turmeric, ginseng,
ginger, beets, and so on. Thus, we say that, "Potatoes are a proper subset
of root vegetables," and write:
${\text{taro} \subset \text{root vegetables}.}$

$$
  A \subset B \iff [\forall x(x \in A \implies x \in B) \land \exists x (x \in B
  \land x \notin A)]
$$

A subset is a general concept. When we say that ${A}$ is a "subset" of
${B,}$ we allow the possibility of ${A}$ and ${B}$ being equal. For
example, the set of all aardvarks is a subset of all Orycteropodidae, and
the set of all Orycteropodidae is a subset of all Tubulidentata. However,
aardvarks comprise all the members of Orycteropodidae, and Orycteropodidae
comprise all the members of Tubulidentata. Thus, these sets are all equal,
but are also subsets.[^bio_note]

[^bio_note]:
    In biology, a taxon (an instance of a taxonomy level, e.g., kingdom,
    phylum, class, etc.) with only one superset is called __monotypic__.
    Aardvarks, the Albany pitcher plant, the hyacinth macaw, among others
    are all monotypic.

Now, if some extinct species of Orycteropodidae comes back to life or some
new species is discovered, then the aardvarks would not comprise all of
Orycteropodidae. In that situation, aardvarks are no longer _just_ a subset
of Orycteropodidae. We can still refer to aardvarks as a subset of
Orycteropodidae, but we are now also permitted to more specifically say
that aardvarks are a _strict subset_ (or _proper subset_) of Orycteropodidae.

<dfn>

__strict subset__. Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ are sets. ${A}$ is a _proper
subset_ of ${B}$ if, and only if, every element of ${A}$ is in ${B,}$
but there is at least one element in $B$ that is not in $A$. If $A$ is a
proper subset of $B$, we write:

$$
  A \subset B
$$

</dfn>


If ${A \subset B}$ is true, we can infer: All of the elements of ${A}$ are
elements of $B$, but there is at least one element of ${B}$ that is not an
element of ${A.}$ We can also infer that all the elements of ${A}$ have
some property in common that separate it from other subsets of ${B.}$

A helpful way to distinguish between the two symbols is noticing how they
share similarities to the symbols ${\leq}$ and ${<.}$ ${\subseteq }$ means
"subset or equal" and ${\subset}$ means "subset but not equal;" the former
is more general than the latter.

If $A \subset B$ is false (i.e., $A$ is not a proper subset of $B$), we
write:

$$
 A \not\subset B
$$

If $A \not\subset B$ is true, then either $A \not\subseteq B$ is true, or
$A \subseteq B$ is true, but no elements in $B$ are not in $A$.

## The Empty Set

Some sets have no members. For example, the set of all positive integers
greater than their squares is the empty set. If there is even a single
element in the set, then the set is not the empty set. Such a set (a set
with a single member) is called a __singleton__.

Importantly, we shouldn't confuse the lack of an element with the lack of a
subset. The empty set does have a subset—the empty set. But the fact that it has
a subset does not imply that it has an element. We will see why this is the case
shortly.

The empty set is both an interesting and useful concept to have. Proferred
by George Boole, the empty set embodies the concept of _nothingness_.
Nothingness is a difficult concept to think about, but as with many things
in mathematics, the idea is encapsulated—abstracted away—into a single
symbol: ${\varnothing.}$ The abstraction allows us to reason about
nothingness differently. Usually, when we think of filling an empty pint
with beer, we tend to think that we are somehow negating the glass's
emptiness; sort of "removing" the nothingness inside the pint.
${\varnothing,}$ however, is a member of every set except itself. We cannot
remove nothingness from the set of all natural numbers—it's always there.

The empty set is a very useful notion, but it can also be a footgun if we don't
use it carefully. To prevent fiascos, we will always denote the empty set with
the null symbol: ${\varnothing.}$ At no point do we ever write:

$$
 \{~~\}
$$

This is equivalent to a spelling mistake in mathematics. Second, the set
containing an empty set is _not_ the same as the empty set:

$$
 \varnothing \neq \{ \varnothing \}
$$

Once more, these are two very different things. One is an actual object
(${\varnothing}$), the other is a box containing a single object
(${\{ \varnothing \}}$). The empty set can be thought of as representing an
empty folder. If we place an empty folder ${A}$ inside an empty folder
${B,}$ then the folder ${A}$ is no longer empty: It contains a folder. The
distinction between elements and subsets is a critical distinction.

### Vacuous Truth

The empty set offers an opportunity to revisit the notion of **vacuous
truth**. Here's the question: Suppose we had a set ${A.}$ Is the empty set
a subset of ${A?}$ The tempting answer is "It depends. What's in ${A?}$"
Unfortunately, the temptation is wrong—it does not depend. Recall the
definition of a subset:

$$
 B \subseteq A \space \iff \space \forall x(x \in B \implies x \in A)
$$

The key point to consider is the condition ${x \in B.}$ Now substitute
${B}$ with ${\varnothing.}$ Is the statement ${x \in \varnothing}$ true? Of
course not. The empty set is empty—there's nothing in it. This means that
the sufficient condition for the definition of a subset is always false
when we consider the empty set as a subset. And what happens when a
sufficient condition is false? The conditional proposition is always true!
This is a vacuous truth: The empty set is a subset of ${A.}$ In fact, the
empty set is a subset of every set, including itself (since the condition
is still false if we substitute ${A}$ with ${\varnothing}$).

The notion of vacuous truth may seem strange, but it follows directly from
logic. Consider the negation of the definition for a subset:

$$
 B \nsubseteq A \space \iff \space \exists x(x \in B \land x \notin A)
$$

In other words, ${B}$ is not a subset of ${A}$ if there's an ${x}$ in ${A}$
that's not in ${B.}$ We know there's nothing in the empty set, so there can
never be an ${x}$ in ${B}$ that's not in ${A.}$ There are no ${xs}$ to
begin with.

This discussion leads to some helpful points regarding proofs concerning
sets:

1. To prove that ${A \subseteq B,}$ show that ${A}$ and ${B}$ are just
   trenchcoats: If ${x}$ is inside ${A,}$ then ${x}$ is also inside ${B.}$

2. To prove that ${A \nsubseteq B,}$ find a culprit: There's at least one
   ${x}$ inside ${A}$ that's not inside ${B.}$

If we think a little more carefully about the definition for subsets,
we'd realize that this whole idea of the empty set being a subset of
itself extends to a more general conclusion:

<dfn>

__theorem__. For every set ${S:}$

$$
  \begin{aligned}
      &\varnothing \subseteq S ~~\text{and}
      &S \subseteq S
  \end{aligned}
$$

</dfn>

Why is this true? Well, we know that since ${\varnothing}$ has no members,
the sufficient condition for the definition of a subset is always false, so
it follows that ${\varnothing \subseteq S}$ is always true. Next, by the
law of identity, every statement implies itself. Thus,
${x \in S \implies x \in S.}$ This implies that every element of ${S}$ is
an element of ${S.}$ And since every element of ${S}$ is an element of
${S,}$ it follows that ${S \subseteq S.}$

## Set Identity

Consider the following sets:

$$
 A = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}\\ B = \{ 3, 2, 1 \}\\ C = \{ 2, 1, 3 \}
$$

By the axiom of extension, ${A,}$ ${B,}$ and ${C}$ all have the same
elements. Observing this, we have the following definition:

<dfn>

__set identity__. Two sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ are _identical_ if, and only if,
every element of ${A}$ an element of ${B,}$ and every element of ${B}$ is
an element of ${A.}$

$$
   A = B \iff \forall x(x \in A \iff x \in B)
$$

</dfn>

From the definition above, given to sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ to prove that
${A}$ is equal to ${B,}$ we prove that ${A \subseteq B}$ and
${B \subseteq A.}$

## Cardinality

Suppose we have the following set, called ${A:}$

$$
 \{ a, b, c, d \}
$$

How many elements are in this set? There are 4. The number of elements in a
set is called the set's __cardinality__. The term _cardinality_ is derived
from the term _cardinal number_ (a number used for counting, rather than
ordering). Cardinality plays a special role in both mathematics and
programming. For example, in computer science, an __uncountable function__
is a function where no computer program can be written to find all its
values. In other words, there are some functions that we, as programmers,
cannot write simply because the _cardinality_ of the function's set of
outputs is either too large to count or cannot be counted at all.

<dfn>

__cardinality__. Given a set ${A,}$ if there are exactly ${m}$ elements in
${A,}$ where ${m \in \NN,}$ then ${A}$ is a _finite set_ with a
_cardinality_ of ${m.}$ We denote this fact with:

$$
  n(A) = m
$$

</dfn>


The notation ${n(A)}$ is not the only one way to denote cardinality. Some
texts denote cardinality with ${\lvert A \rvert }$ and ${\text{card}(A) .}$
We use ${n(A),}$ but will switch notations as necessary for clarity. Note
that when analyzing cardinality, the axiom of extension applies. The set
${A = \{ 1, 1, 2 \}}$ and ${B = \{ 1, 2 \}}$ are the same sets. Thus, both
${A}$ and ${B}$ have a cardinality of 2 (i.e., ${n(A) = n(B) = 2.}$)

Another useful fact when handling cardinality: The empty set is the only
set with a cardinality of 0:

<dfn>

__cardinality of the null__. Given a set ${A,}$ if ${n(A) = 0,}$ then ${A}$ is
the empty set, ${\varnothing.}$

</dfn>

Further note that because sets denote the number of elements in a set, for
our purposes, we follow the axiom that cardinality can never be
negative.[^neg_note] Because we're discussing set algebra, we are careful
to state this axiom explicitly:

[^neg_note]:
    Negative cardinality is a concept explored in modern mathematics, but
    it is beyond the scope of these materials.

<dfn>

__positivity of cardinality.__ Given a set ${A,}$ ${n(A) \geq 0.}$

</dfn>

### One-to-One Correspondence

When Oliver Twist asked for more gruel, the master grew pale and aimed a
blow at Oliver's head. Why? Because at meal time, each child was to receive
one, and only one, serving of gruel. Suppose each boy is a member of the
set ${\text{workers},}$ and each serving of gruel is a member of the set
${\text{servings}.}$ Then, each element of ${\text{workers}}$ gets one, and
only one, element of ${\text{servings}.}$ In mathematics, we call this
_one-to-one correspondence_.

<dfn>

__one-to-one correspondence__. Let ${A = \{ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \}}$ and ${B = \{ b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \}}$ be sets.

${A}$ and ${B}$ are in _one-to-one correspondence_ if there exists a pairing of
the elements of ${A}$ to the elements of ${B,}$ such that each ${a \in A}$
corresponds to one, and only one, ${b \in B,}$ and each ${b \in B}$ corresponds
to one, and only one, ${a \in A.}$

</dfn>

### Equinumerosity

When a set ${A}$ and ${B}$ have the same cardinality, we say that ${A}$ and
${B}$ are _equinumerous_. As we'll see in later chapters, know whether sets are
equinumerous is a powerful fact utilized in not just set theory, but many other
areas of mathematics.

<dfn>

__equinumerosity__. Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be sets. ${A}$ and ${B}$ have the same
cardinality if, and only if, there is a one-to-one correspondence from ${A}$ to
${B.}$ If ${A}$ and ${B}$ have the same cardinality, we say that ${A}$ and ${B}$ are _equinumerous_, and write

$$
  n(A) = n(B).
$$

</dfn>

Without going into the details now, we can compare the cardinalities of sets
with the classical comparison operators. For example, when we write ${n(A) <
n(B)}$, we are stating, "Set ${A}$ is smaller than set ${B.}$" When we write
${n(A) \geq n(B),}$ we are stating, "Set ${A}$ is smaller or the same size as
set ${B.}$"

### Countability

Careful thought into sets reveals that there are some sets we can't count.
For example, intuitively, we might think that because there are infinitely
many integers, there are infinitely many odd positive integers, so we
simply can't count all of the odd positive integers. This intuition,
however, is wrong. Why? Because mathematics has a very strict definition of
"countable":

<dfn>

__countability__. A set ${S}$ is _countable_ if, and only if:

1. ${S}$ is finite, or
2. ${n(S) = n(\ZZ^{+}).}$

Otherwise, ${S}$ is _uncountable._

If ${S}$ is an infinite set and countable, we denote the cardinality of ${S}$ by
writing ${n(S) = \alef_0,}$ and say "${S}$ has cardinality aleph null."

</dfn>

Based on this definition, we can see that the set of odd positive integers,
${\Z_{\text{odd}},}$ is a countable set. Why? Consider the function
${f(n) = 2n - 1,}$ where ${n \in \ZZ^{+}.}$ This function maps the set of
positive integers to the set of odd numbers. Now, recall the definition for
when two sets are considered equal. They are equal iff there is a
one-to-one correspondence between ${\ZZ^{+}}$ and ${\Z_{\text{odd}}.}$ Two
sets have one-to-one correspondence if they are both (a) one-to-one and (b)
onto.

The first requirement, (a), is satisfied. Suppose that ${f(n) = f(m).}$
From this assumption, it follows that ${2n - 1 = 2m - 1.}$ It then follows
that ${n = m.}$ This proves that the set is onto.

The second requirement, (b), is satisfied. Let's say there's some odd
positive integer ${s.}$ Since ${s}$ is an odd positive integer, it is a
positive integer of the form ${2k - 1,}$ where ${k \in \ZZ^{+}.}$ This in
turn means that ${s}$ will always be less than an even positive integer
${2k.}$ As such, it follows that ${s = 2k - 1 = f(k).}$ And given this
fact, no ${s,}$ an odd positive integer, can map to even integer. It
follows then that the odd positive integers will always map to the positive
integers.

Satisfying both (a) and (b), the function ${f}$ is a one-to-one
correspondence from ${\ZZ^{+}}$ to ${\Z_{\text{odd}}.}$ And because it is of
one-to-one correspondence, it follows that
${n(\Z_{\text{odd}}) = n(\ZZ^{+}).}$ This satisfies the definition of
countability above—the set of odd positive integers is countable.



## Set Union

Suppose there are two sets, $A$ and $B$. The __union__ of $A$ and $B$,
denoted ${A \cup B,}$ is the set of all elements of both $A$ and $B$.
Visually:

<Fig link={

} caption={"The union of A and B"} width={"30"} imwidth={"81"} imheight={"61"}
/>

Venn diagrams are named after the English mathematician John Venn, who
introduced their usage in 1881. More formally:

<dfn>

__set union__. Given sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ ${A \cup B}$ is the set of all
elements in either ${A,}$ ${B,}$ or both ${A}$ and ${B.}$

</dfn>

### Big Union Operator

In some cases, we want to express the notion of a union of many sets. For
example, suppose we had the sets:

<Grid cols={3}>

$$
  A_1 = \set{a_1, a_2, a_3}
$$

$$
  A_2 = \set{a_4, a_5, a_6}
$$

$$
  A_3 = \set{a_7, a_8, a_9}
$$

</Grid>

We could express the union of all three of these sets by writing:

$$
  A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3
$$

However, we can also communicate the same idea by writing:

$$
  \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n} A_i
$$

The big "U" is is colloquially called the "big union" or "big cup" (from its
corresponding LaTeX command, `\bigcup`).

<dfn>

__big union__. Let ${A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n}$ be sets. The union of these
sets is denoted:

$$
  \large \bigcup\limits_{i = 1}^{n} A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \ldots \cup A_n
$$

</dfn>


### Cardinality of Unions

Working with set theory, knowing the size of a union is tremendously
useful. However, we must be careful when counting the elements. Because
${A \cup B}$ consists of all the elements in ${A,}$ ${B,}$ and the elements
in both ${A}$ and ${B,}$ the elements in both ${A}$ and ${B}$ are counted
twice. Accordingly, we must subtract the intersection of ${A}$ and ${B}$ to
retrieve the correct cardinality. This is called the **principle of
inclusion-exclusion**:

<dfn>

__principle of inclusion-exclusion__. Given ${A \cup B,}$

$$
  n(A \cup B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \cap B)
$$

</dfn>


## Set Intersection

In the Venn diagram below, the grey region is called the _set intersection_.

<Fig link={
"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653359232/math/A_intersect_B_gha4ac.svg"
} caption={"The intersection of A and B"} width={"30"} imwidth={"81"}
imheight={"61"} />

Here is the definition of intersection:

<dfn>

__intersection.__ Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be sets. The _intersection_ of ${A}$ and
${B,}$ denoted

$$
  A \cap B,
$$

is set of elements that are members of ${A}$ and members of ${B.}$ That is, if

$$
  x \in A \cap B,
$$

then ${x \in A}$ _and_ ${x \in B.}$

</dfn>

This is a deceptively simple definition. For example, ${\set{1,2,3} \cap \set{2,3,4}}$ very clearly yields the intersection ${\{ 2, 3 \}.}$ But here's a
slighly more devilish one:

$$
  \set{1,2,3} \cap \set{3,4,5}.
$$

It's very tempting to say the intersection here is 3. The correct answer,
however, is

$$
  \set{3}
$$

The slip is forgetting the fact that the intersection operation _always_ returns
a set. As an aside, because of how long the word "intersection" is, the symbol
${\cap}$ is often read "cap" (again from its corresponding LaTeX command,
`\cap`). For example, the expression

$$
  A \cap B
$$

is often read "${A}$ cap ${B.}$" 

### Big Intersection

Like the union operator, we have some shortcut notation for taking many
intersections (the "big cap" operator).

<dfn>

__big intersection__. Let ${A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n}$ be sets. The _intersection_
of these sets may be denoted as:

$$
 \large \bigcap\limits_{i = 1}^{n} A_i = A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \ldots \cap A_n.
$$

</dfn>



### Cardinalities of Intersections and Unions

Suppose we had the following sets ${A}$ and ${B:}$

$$
 \begin{aligned} A &= \{ 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 14, 22 \} \\ B &= \{ 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13 \} \end{aligned}
$$

As a Venn diagram, sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ are visualized as such:

<Fig
	link={
		"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653359316/math/cardinality_intersection_mp0b1m.svg"
	}
	caption={"An explicit intersection"}
	width={40}
	imwidth={314}
	imheight={220}
/>

We see that the union of ${A}$ and ${B}$ is:

$$
 A \cup B = \{ 5, 2, 11 \}
$$

The cardinalities of the sets and the union:

$$
 \begin{aligned} n(A) &= 8 \\ n(B) &= 9 \\ n(A \cup B) &= 14 \\ n(A \cap B) &= 3 \end{aligned}
$$

Notice that the cardinality of the union is not simply ${n(A) + n(B).}$
This is because simply adding ${n(A)}$ and ${n(B)}$ results in counting the
elements in the intersection twice. Accordingly, to compute the cardinality
of ${A \cup B,}$ we must subtract ${A \cap B.}$ This yields the following
formula:


<dfn>

__lemma__. Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be non-empty, finite sets. The cardinality
of ${A \cup B}$ is given by the formula:

$$
   n(A \cup B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \cap B)
$$


</dfn>


From the above formula, we can derive a second formula for the cardinality
of the intersection:


<dfn>

__lemma__. Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be non-empty, finite sets. The cardinality
of ${A \cap B}$ is given by the formula:

$$
 n(A \cap B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \cup B)
$$

</dfn>

## Disjoint Sets

Some sets have no elements in common, and we call them _disjoint._ For example,
the two sets below are disjoint:

<Fig link={
"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1661563418/math/disjoint_sets_mwr7xr.svg"
} imwidth={"526"} imheight={"326"} caption={"Disjoint sets"} width={"30"} />

Here's an explicit definition:

<dfn>

__disjoint sets.__ Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be sets. If

$$
  A \cap B = \nil,
$$

then ${A}$ and ${B}$ are said to be _disjoint_. That is, ${A}$ and ${B}$ have no
elements in common.

</dfn>

### Disjoint Union

Say we had the following sets:

$$
  \eqs{
    A &= \set{a,b,c} \\
    B &= \set{3,5,7}.
  }
$$

The sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ have nothing in common. I.e.,

$$
  A \cap B = \nil
$$

What if we want to express the set

$$
  \set{a,b,c,3,5,7}
$$

while maintaining the fact that ${A}$ and ${B}$ are disjoint? The notation ${A
\cup B}$ doesn't tell us anything about whether ${A}$ and ${B}$ are disjoint.
Fortunately, we have a special symbol for this, called the _disjoint union_:

$$
  A \sqcup B
$$

This is simply the union operator, but with the added restriction that its
operands ${A}$ and ${B}$ must be disjoint.


## Set Difference

Let $A$ and $B$ both be sets. The difference of $A$ and $B$, denoted
${A \setminus B}$ (read "$A$ set minus $B$) is the set of all elements in
$A$ and not in $B.$ In other words,
${A \setminus B = \{ x : (x \in A) \land (x \notin B) \}.}$

<Fig link={
"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653359559/math/A_setMinus_B_hpc3xw.svg"
} caption={"The difference of A and B"} width={"30"} imwidth={"127"}
imheight={"95"} />

More formally:

<dfn>

__definition: set difference__. Given sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ >
${A \setminus B}$ is the set containing all the elements in ${A}$ that
are not contained in ${B.}$

</dfn>

We say that ${A \setminus B}$ is the _complement_ of ${B}$ with respect
to ${A.}$

## Complements

The complement of a set ${S}$ more generally refers to the set of all
elements not contained in ${S.}$ If we have a defined universal set ${U}$
and ${A \subset U,}$ then the complement of ${A}$ is the set of all
elements in ${U}$ that are not inside ${A.}$

<dfn>

__definition: complement__. Suppose ${U}$ is the universal set. The
complement of the set ${A,}$ denoted ${\overline{\rm A},}$ is the
_complement_ of ${A}$ with respect to ${U.}$ Hence:

$$
  \overline{\rm A} = U \setminus A
$$

Or, alternatively:

$$
   \overline{\rm A} = U - A
$$

</dfn>


## Set Identities

Knowing the set operations, it's often helpful to know several _set
identities_ by heart to quickly perform deductions. These identities are
presented below:

| Name                | Identity                                                             |

| Domination Law 2    | ${A \cap \varnothing = \varnothing}$                                 |
| Indempotent Law 1   | ${A \cup A = A}$                                                     |
| Indempotent Law 1   | ${A \cap A = A}$                                                     |
| Complementation Law | ${\overline{\rm (\overline{\rm A})} = A}$                            |
| Commutative Law 1   | ${A \cup B = B \cup A}$                                              |
| Commutative Law 2   | ${A \cap B = B \cap A}$                                              |
| Associative Law 1   | ${A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C}$                            |
| Associative Law 2   | ${A \cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B) \cap C}$                            |
| Distributive Law 1  | ${A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)}$                   |
| Distributive Law 2  | ${A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)}$                   |
| De Morgan's Law 1   | ${\overline{\rm A \cap B} = \overline{\rm A} \cup \overline{\rm B}}$ |

| Absorption Law 1    | ${A \cup (A \cap B) = A}$                                            |
| Absorption Law 2    | ${A \cap (A \cup B) = A}$                                            |
| Complement Law 1    | ${A \cup \overline{\rm A} = U}$                                      |
| Complement Law 2    | ${A \cap \overline{\rm A} = \varnothing}$                            |

## Symmetric Difference

The __symmetric difference__ between two sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ is defined
as:

$$
	A \Delta B = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)
$$

That is to say, the symmetric difference of sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ is the set
made up of all the elements which are in ${A}$ or ${B}$ but not both. We
can think of this as akin to the "exclusive or."

The symmetric difference has the following properties:

<div className="numbered">

|                |                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ~property i~   | ${A \Delta B = B \Delta A}$                       |
| ~property ii~  | ${A \Delta (B \Delta C) = (A \Delta B) \Delta C}$ |
| ~property iii~ | ${A \Delta \varnothing = A}$                      |
| ~property iv~  | ${A \Delta A = \varnothing}$                      |
| ~property v~   | ${A \Delta A' = \mathbb{U}}$                      |

</div>

## Power Sets

A mathematician requested a VISA to enter the United States with his family
(him, his wife, and his son). The embassy replied, "Please submit passport
photos of your family." Unsure whether multiple persons were supposed to be
in each photo, the mathematician took one for every combination. Each on
their own, him and his wife, him and his son, his wife and his son, etc.
Photos taken, the mathematician returned to the embassy.

The clerk was dumbfounded. After several minutes she said, "There's no one
in this photo."

"Yes. That is a photo of the empty set."

This amusing exchange illustrates the notion of a power set. Consider the set
${B = \{ 0, 1 \},}$ the set of binary digits. Using our definition of subsets,
what are all the different possible subsets of ${B?}$ We can lay them out:

<Grid cols={2}>

$$
	\varnothing
$$

$$
	\set{0}
$$

$$
	\set{1}
$$

$$
	\set{0,1}
$$

</Grid>


There are four different possible subsets. Suppose we place all these
possible subsets in an entirely new set:

$$
 \{ \varnothing, \{ 0 \}, \{ 1 \}, \{ 0, 1 \} \}
$$

We call the set above the __power set__ of ${B,}$ and denote as:

$$
 \mathcal{P}(B) = \{ \varnothing, \{ 0 \}, \{ 1 \}, \{ 0, 1 \} \}
$$

The symbol ${\mathcal{P}}$ is used in these notes, but other symbols are
used throughout mathematics: ${\mathscr{P}, \mathbb{P}, \wp,}$ and a few
others. Defining the power set more formally:


<dfn>

__power set__. Given a set ${S,}$ the _power set_ of ${S}$ is the set of
all subsets of the set ${S.}$ The power set of ${S}$ is denoted
${\mathcal{P}(S).}$

</dfn>

One peculiar application of the definition above is with the empty set.
What is the size of the power set of ${\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)?}$ It is 1,
since the only subset of ${\varnothing}$ is ${\{\varnothing\}.}$ Next, what
is the size of the power set of ${ \{ \varnothing \}?}$ It is 2, since
${\mathcal{P}(\{ \varnothing \}) = \{ \varnothing, \{ \varnothing \} \}.}$
If we continue this pattern:

$$
 \begin{aligned}
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)) = 1 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing))) = 2 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)))) = 3 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing))))) = 4 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)))))) = 5 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing))))))) = 6 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)))))))) = 7 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing))))))))) = 8 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)))))))))) = 9 \\
  &n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\varnothing))))))))))) = 10 \\
 \end{aligned}
$$

The pattern above yields to a direct corollary (as well as several other
ideas we will explore in the sections on number theory):

<dfn>

__corollary__. If as set ${A}$ has ${n}$ elements, where ${n \in \NN,}$ then
${\mathcal{P}(A) = 2^n.}$

</dfn>

The proof of this corollary: Let ${A}$ be a set. For every subset of ${A,}$
there are two possibilities for each element ${x \in A:}$ Either (1) ${x}$
is in the subset, or ${x}$ is not in the subset. Therefore, it follows that
for ${n}$ elements, there are ${2^n}$ possibilities in making a subset of
${A.}$ From the definition of the powerset, it follows that the number of
subsets of ${A}$ is ${2^n.}$

## Big Unions & Intersections

At this point, we have a much better understanding of basic set theory. We
can now introduce the generalized forms of unions and intersections.
Because sets comply with the laws of associativity, the sets
${A \cup B \cup C}$ and ${A \cap B \cap C}$ are unambiguous. In other
words, we don't need parentheses to communicate what we mean.
${A \cup B \cup C}$ is the same set as ${(A \cup B) \cup C}$ which is the
same set as ${A \cup (B \cup C).}$ The same goes for ${A \cap B \cap C.}$

For example, suppose ${A = \{ 1, 2 \},}$ ${B = \{ 1, 4 \},}$ and
${C = \{ 1, 7 \}.}$ Then ${A \cup B \cup C = \{ 1, 2, 4, 7 \},}$ and
${A \cap B \cap C = \{ 1 \}.}$ The set ${A \cup B \cup C}$ is the set
containing all the elements that occur in at least one of ${A,}$ ${B,}$ and
${C.}$ The set ${A \cap B \cap C}$ contains all the elements in all three
of ${A,}$ ${B,}$ and ${C.}$ We can extend this idea to any ${n}$ number of
sets:


From the definition above, it follows that the notation
${\bigcup\limits_{i = 1}^{n} A_i}$ represents a set. Accordingly, when we
write ${x \in \bigcup\limits_{i = 1}^{n} A_i,}$ we imply that ${x}$ is a
member of at least one of ${A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n.}$ This idea also applies
to intersections:


## Special Number Sets

Certain number sets are used so frequently in mathematics that we denote
them with symbols.

| Symbol               | Set                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\mathbb{R}$         | The set of all real numbers. E.g., $\{ -2, 0, 1, \pi, \sqrt{2}, \ldots \}$                                                                                                   |
| $\mathbb{R}^-$       | The set of all negative real numbers. E.g., $\{ - \sqrt{3}, -1, -117, \ldots \}$. This set does not include 0.                                                               |
| ${\R_{\leq 0}}$      | The set of all nonpositive real numbers. This is the set of negative real numbers including 0.                                                                               |
| $\mathbb{R}^+$       | The set of all positive real numbers. E.g., $\{ 2, \pi, e, \frac{1}{2}, \ldots \}$. This set does not include 0.                                                             |
| ${\R_{\geq 0}}$      | The set of all nonnegative positive real numbers. This is the set of all positive real numbers including 0.                                                                  |
| $\mathbb{Q}$         | The set of all rational numbers. These are numbers that can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. E.g., $\{ 3, 0, -2, 0.75, \ldots \}$.             |
| $\mathbb{I}$         | The set of all irrational numbers. This is the set of all numbers that are not rational numbers. E.g., $\{ - \sqrt{2}, \pi, \phi, e, \ldots \}$.                             |
| $\mathbb{Z}$         | The set of all integers. This is the set of what we refer to as the counting numbers, and their negative counterparts. E.g., $\{ \ldots -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$.  |
| $\mathbb{Z}^-$       | The set of all negative integers. This is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$. It consists of all the negative integers. E.g., $\{ -1, -2, -3, \ldots \}$. This set does not include 0. |
| $\mathbb{Z}^+$       | The set of all positive integers. Another subset of $\mathbb{Z}$. It consists of all the positive integers. E.g., $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \}$. This set does not include 0.   |
| ${\N_{\mathcal{E}}}$ | The set of all even numbers. This is the set of all integers that can be written in the form $2k$, where $k$ is an integer. E.g., $\{ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 \}$.                 |
| ${\N_{\mathcal{O}}}$ | The set of all odd numbers. This is the set of all integers that can be written in the form $2k + 1$, where $k$ is an integer. E.g., $\{ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \ldots \}$           |
| $\mathbb{N}$         | The set of all natural numbers. This is the set of all counting numbers (equivalent to the set of positive integers). E.g., $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \}$.                      |
| $\mathbb{P}$         | The set of all prime numbers. E.g., $\{ 2, 3, 5, 7, \ldots \}$.                                                                                                              |
