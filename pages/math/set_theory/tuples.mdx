When set theory was first introduced, it faced a major issue—how do you
represent ordered pairs? That is, given the set ${\set{a,b},}$ how do you
communicate that ${a}$ is first and ${b}$ is second, purely in the language of
set theory?

Sets, by definition, are unordered. Thus, ${\set{a,b}}$ is the same set as
${\set{b,a}.}$ This is problematic because we have no way of communicating
"${a}$ then ${b}$" purely in the language of set theory — there's no way to
distinguish between ${\set{a,b}}$ and ${\set{b,a}.}$

## Ordered Pairs

In 1921, the Polish logician Kazimierz Kuratowski offered the following
definition:

<dfn>

__ordered pair.__ An ordered pair, denoted ${(a,b),}$ is defined as:

$$
	(a,b) = \set{ \set{a}, \set{a,b}}
$$

</dfn>

This is one of the greatest examples of "working with what you've got" and the
extent of mathematical cleverness. Kuratowski essentially said: "Why are we
so concerned about which goes first and which goes second? It's unnecessary."
And he had a point. The notion of "first" and "second" is entirely relative.

Suppose we had two objects side by side.

$$
	\large a ~~~ b
$$

If we read from left to right, ${a}$ is first and ${b}$ is second. If we read
from right to left — a perfectly permissible thing to do — then ${b}$ is first
and ${a}$ is second. If we read it from top to bottom — again perfectly
permissible — then, well, all bets are off. Kuratowski was astute enough to
realize that searching for a way to define "first" and "second" was a zero sum
game. Even if we managed to establish a rigorous definition for "first" and
"second," the situation wouldn't change because there would always be an
alternative view.

To Kuratowski, the notions of "first" and "second" are just convenient ways of
achieving what we're really after: A way of communicating the idea that

$$
	\large a~~~b
$$

is different from

$$
	\large b~~~a.
$$

Thus, we don't need a way to establish what's first or second. What we need is a
way to distinguish between two sets. If we look at Kuratowski's definition, it
does exactly that. Let's say ${a = 0}$ and ${b = 1.}$ Then, by Kuratowski's
definition, we have:

$$
	(0,1) = \set{ \set{0}, \set{0,1}}
$$

Now let's say ${a = 1}$ and ${b = 0.}$ Then we have:

$$
	(1,0) = \set{ \set{1}, \set{1,0}}
$$

Looking at the two sets, we see that they are, in fact, different:

$$
	(0,1) = \set{ \set{0}, \set{0,1}} \\	
	(1,0) = \set{ \set{1}, \set{1,0}}
$$

Because we have a way of distinguishing between ${(a,b)}$ and ${(b,a),}$ the
notion of "first" and "second" is just a cherry on top, and it just so happens
that we prefer interpreting ${(a,b)}$ as "${a}$ is first, and ${b}$ is second."

An added benefit of Kuratowski's definition is that it allows us to state when
two ordered pairs are equal:

<dfn>

__equality of ordered pairs.__ Let $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ be ordered pairs. Then

$$
	(a,b) = (c,d)
$$

if, and only if, 

$$
	a = c ~~~\text{and}~~~ b = d
$$

</dfn>

## Tuples

Ordered pairs allow us to express a pair ${(a,b).}$ But what if we want to
express something like:

$$
	(a,b,c)
$$

Well, we can take a similar approach to Kuratowski's. But instead of nesting a
set, we'll nest an ordered pair: 

$$
	(a, (b,c))
$$

Again, what's important is that we have a way of distinguishing the set
represented by the expression above and some other set. If we expanded the above
expression, we'd get:

$$
	\set{\set{a}, \set{a, \set{\set{b}, \set{b,c}}}}
$$

Once more, we still have a way to differentiate between sets. Suppose ${a=1,}$
${b=2,}$ and ${c=3.}$ Then:

$$
	(1,2,3)=\set{\set{1}, \set{1, \set{\set{2}, \set{2,3}}}}
$$

Now suppose ${a=1,b=3,c=2.}$ Then:

$$
	(1,3,2)=\set{\set{1}, \set{1, \set{\set{3}, \set{3, 2}}}}
$$

Those are very clearly different sets. The fact that we're simply nesting
ordered pairs allows us to extend the same idea to ${n}$ elements.

$$
	(1,2,3,4,\ldots,n)
$$

We call the construct above an _${n}$-tuple_. Notice that this effectively
generalizes the notion of an ordered pair — an ordered pair is simply a 2-tuple.

<dfn>

__n-tuple.__ Where ${n \in \nat,}$ the collection:

$$	
(a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots,a_n) = 
\begin{cases}
		\nil           & ~~\text{if}~~ n = 0 \\[1em]
		(a_1, (a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n)) & ~~\text{else}~~
\end{cases}
$$

is called an ${n}$-tuple.

</dfn>

## The Cartesian Product

With the notion of tuples, we can now represent a wide variety of objects
mathematically. Suppose we have two sets:

$$
	A = \set{x,y,z} 
	~~~~
	B = \set{1,2,3}
$$

Now that we have tuples, we can create a set that contains all the possible
2-tuples ${(a,b),}$ where ${a \in A}$ and ${b \in B.}$ Let's explicitly lay out
that set:

$$
	A \times B =
	\lset{
		\eqs{
			& (x,1), & (x,2), && (x,3) & \\
			& (y,1), & (y,2), && (y,3) & \\
			& (z,1), & (z,2), && (z,3) &
		}
	}
$$

More explicitly:

<dfn>

__Cartesian Product.__ Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be sets. The set

$$
	A \times B
$$

is the set of all tuples ${(a,b),}$ where ${a \in A}$ and ${b \in B.}$

</dfn>

Because we have the notion of ${n}$-tuples, we can also define the Cartesian
product generally:

<dfn>

__General Definition of the Cartesian Product.__ The ${A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n}$
be sets. The _Cartesian product_ of the sets ${A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n,}$ denoted

$$
		A_1 \times A_2 \times \ldots \times A_n,
$$

is the set of all ${n}$-tuples ${(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)}$ where ${a_i \in
A_i}$ for ${i = 1,2,\ldots,n.}$ That is,

$$
	\small
	A_1 \times A_2 \times \ldots \times A_n	= \set{(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n) : a_i \in
	A_i \text{ for } i=1,2,3,\ldots,n}
$$

</dfn>

### Cardinality of the Cartesian Product

Given that the Cartesian product is the set of all tuples ${(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)}$ where ${a \in A_1,}$ ${a_2 \in A_2,}$ ${\ldots,}$ ${a_n \in A_n}$ with ${n \in \nat,}$ we have the following theorem.

<dfn>

__cardinality of the cartesian product.__ Let ${A_1, A_2, \ldots A_n}$ be sets, with ${n \in \nat.}$ Then

$$
	\card{(A_1 \times A_2 \times \ldots \times A_n)} = \card{(A_1)} \times \card{(A_2)} \ldots \times \card{(A_n).}
$$

</dfn>

For example, given the set ${B = \set{0,1},}$ then the cardinality of ${B \times B}$ is ${4,}$ since:

$$
	B \times B = \lset{
		\eqs{
			(0,0)~&~(0,1) \\
			(1,0)~&~(1,1)
		}
	}.	
$$
