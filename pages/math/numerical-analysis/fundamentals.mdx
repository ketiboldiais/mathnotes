# Fundamentals

_This is the first note on numerical analysis_.

## Evaluating Polynomials

Suppose we're given the polynomial ${p(x)=-2x^4 + 9x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x + 4.}$ The graph of ${p(x)}$ appears as follows:

<Plot
	data={[{f:(x)=>(-2*x**4) + (9*x**3) + (2*x**2) - (7*x) + 4}]}
	domain={[-5,10]}
	range={[-40,100]}
	ticks={0}
	scale={60}
/>

How might we evaluate this polynomial for some inputs ${x=-2?}$ The naive approach is to simply compute this as is:

```bash
let px = -2*(-2)**4 + 9*(-2)**3 + 2*(-2)**2 - 7*(-2)**1 + 4
```

Simple enough. We get the output: ${-58.}$ Now suppose we're asked to perform several evaluations: ${x_0 = -2, x_1 = 17, x_2 = 4.}$ We could perform them one at a time:


```bash
let px0 = -2*(-2)**4 + 9*(-2)**3 + 2*(-2)**2 - 7*(-2)**1 + 4
let px1 = -2*(17)**4 + 9*(17)**3 + 2*(17)**2 - 7*(17)**1 + 4
let px2 = -2*(4)**4 + 9*(4)**3 + 2*(4)**2 - 7*(4)**1 + 4
```

Here, we get `px0=-78`, `px1=-122362`, and `px2=152`. There's some repetitive code appearing here, so we might want to store the inputs in some variable ${x:}$

```bash
let x = -2;
let px0 = -2*(x)**4 + 9*(x)**3 + 2*(x)**2 - 7*(x)**1 + 4
x = 17;
let px1 = -2*(x)**4 + 9*(x)**3 + 2*(x)**2 - 7*(x)**1 + 4
x = 4;
let px2 = -2*(x)**4 + 9*(x)**3 + 2*(x)**2 - 7*(x)**1 + 4
```

Again, we get the same answers. The polynomial remains the same, so let's just put it in a function:

```bash
function px(x) {
	return -2*(x)**4 + 9*(x)**3 + 2*(x)**2 - 7*(x)**1 + 4;
}
let px0 = px(-2);
let px1 = px(17);
let px2 = px(4);
```

Instead of storing these outputs in a single variable, perhaps we ought to store them in an array:

```bash
function px(x) {
	return -2*(x)**4 + 9*(x)**3 + 2*(x)**2 - 7*(x)**1 + 4;
}
let pxs = [px(-2), px(17), px(4)];
```
We can make this even more generic by defining the function `px` to take on an array of `x` values:

```bash
function px(xs:integer[]) {
	let out = [];
	for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++) {
		let x = xs[i];
		out.push(-2*(x)**4 + 9*(x)**3 + 2*(x)**2 - 7*(x)**1 + 4);
	}
	return out;
}
let pxs = px([-2, 17, 4]);
```

There are infinitely man polynomials, so we might like to make our `px` function more generic. Rather than using hardcoded constants, let's make pass an array of constants: 

```bash
function px(xs:number[],cs:number[]) {
	let out = [];
	for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++) {
		let x = xs[i];
		out.push(cs[0]*(x)**4 + cs[1]*(x)**3 + cs[2]*(x)**2 + cs[3]*(x)**1 + cs[4]);
	}
	return out;
}
let pxs = px([-2, 17, 4],[-2,9,2,-7,4]);
```
As is, we're limited to four terms. Moreover, we're hardcoding the indices. Can we get around this? If we think about it a bit more carefully, we'd see that a polynomial is really an accumulation of sums:

```bash
function px(xs:number[],cs:number[]) {
	let out = [];
	for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++) {
		let x = xs[i];
		let C = cs[4];
		C = C + cs[3]*(x)**1;
		C = C + cs[2]*(x)**2;
		C = C + cs[1]*(x)**3;
		C = C + cs[0]*(x)**4;
		out.push(C);
	}
	return out;
}
let pxs = px([-2, 17, 4],[-2,9,2,-7,4]);
```
To make things clearer, let's reverse the order the constants are placed. Instead of `[-2,9,2,-7,4]`, we write `[4,-7,2,9,-2]`:

```bash
function px(xs:number[],cs:number[]) {
	let out = [];
	let xsLength = xs.length;
	for (let i = 0; i < xsLength; i++) {
		let x = xs[i];
		let C = cs[0];
		C = C + cs[1]*(x)**1;
		C = C + cs[2]*(x)**2;
		C = C + cs[3]*(x)**3;
		C = C + cs[4]*(x)**4;
		out.push(C);
	}
	return out;
}
let pxs = px([-2, 17, 4],[4,-7,2,9,-2]);
```
And in actuality, the constant term can be expressed as `C = cs[0]*(x)**0`. That is, ${Cx^0:}$

```bash
function px(xs:number[],cs:number[]) {
	let out = [];
	for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++) {
		let x = xs[i];
		let C = cs[0]*(x)**0;
		C = C + cs[1]*(x)**1;
		C = C + cs[2]*(x)**2;
		C = C + cs[3]*(x)**3;
		C = C + cs[4]*(x)**4;
		out.push(C);
	}
	return out;
}
let pxs = px([-2, 17, 4],[4,-7,2,9,-2]);
```
Of course, this now means we need an inner for loop. We'll get rid of the `x**0`, as that was purely for illustrative purposes:

```bash
function px(xs:number[],cs:number[]) {
	let out = [];
	for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++) {
		let x = xs[i];
		let C = cs[0];
		for (let j = 1; j < cs.length; j++) {
			C = C + cs[j]*(x)**j;
		}
		out.push(C);
	}
	return out;
}
let pxs = px([-2, 17, 4],[4,-7,2,9,-2]);
```

What's the time complexity for this function? Suppose we have ${n}$ variables and ${m}$ constants. We have a step for the `out` initialization (1). Another step for the `i` initialization (1). The first for loop checks its condition ${n+1}$ times, and increments ${n}$ times (${2n + 1}$). Each loop has two initilizations (2) and a push (1). Then we have the second loop. One step for the initialization (1), ${m + 1}$ steps for the check and ${m}$ steps for the increment (${2m + 1}$), and one step for the `C` update (1). After all of that, we have a return (1). Putting it all together:

$$
	\eqs{
		t(n,m) &= (1 + (2n+1)(3))((2m+1)(1+1)) + 1 \\
					 &= (6n+4)(4m+2) + 1 \\
					 &= 24nm + 12n + 16m + 9
	}
$$
