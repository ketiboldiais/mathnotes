## Weighted Average

The idea of a weighted average is that we take the integral of some
function from ${a}$ to ${b,}$ and multiply it by some _weight_, and divide
it by the total weighting:

$$
 \dfrac
 {\displaystyle \integral{a}{b} f(x) \cdot w(x)~dx}
 {\displaystyle \integral{a}{b} w(x) dx}
$$

This definition isn't that unusual. Think about the average we computed in
grade school. We have some list of values:

$$
 \ix{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, \ldots, v_n}
$$

and we divide the sum of all these values by the number of terms:

$$
 \dfrac
  {v_1 + v_2 + v_3 + v_4 + \ldots + v_n}
  {n}
$$

This is the _discrete version_ of an average â€” what we know as the
_arithmetic mean_. The _continuous version_ of an average is the definition
above: a _weighted average_. Of note, many statistics textbooks often
define the weighted average as:

$$
 \overline{x}_{wtd} = \dfrac
  {\dsum{i=1}{n} w_i x_i}
  {\dsum{i=1}{n} w_i}
$$

The notion of a weighted average brings us to one of the most important
applications of integration in the modern era: probability.

## Probability

Suppose we had the following graph:

<Plot data={[
  {f:(x)=>1-x**2}
]}
domain={[-2,2]}
range={[0,1.5]}
scale={70}
/>

if we picked a point "at random" in the region ${0 \ltn y \ltn 1-x^2,}$ what is
the probability that ${x \gtn \frac{1}{2}?}$ Casting this question in
probability terms, this question asks for the probability:

$$
  \P \ar{x \gtn \frac{1}{2}}
$$

From the perspective of calculus, a probability is simply a special kind of
ratio. Specifically, a ratio of the part of something to the whole of something:

$$
  \dfrac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}}
$$

The part that we're interested in:

<Plot data={[
  {f:(x)=>1-x**2, integrate:[0.5,1,`x`]}
]}
domain={[-2,2]}
range={[0,1.5]}
scale={70}
/>

This is a straightforward integration problem. That area is:

$$
  \dfrac{\displaystyle \int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{1} 1-x^2 ~dx}
  {\displaystyle \int_{-1}^{1} 1-x^2 ~dx}
$$

As we saw with the weighted average, the weighting factor here is:

$$
  w(x) = 1-x^2
$$

And just to be more explicit, our starting point is ${-1,}$ and our ending point
is ${b = 1.}$ Working out the computation, we get:

$$
  \P \ar{x \gtn \frac{1}{2}} = \dfrac{5}{32}
$$

We can generalize this computation with the following formula:

$$
  \P(x_1 \ltn x \ltn x_2) 
  = 
  \dfrac
  {\text{part}}
  {\text{whole}}
  =
  \dfrac
  {\displaystyle \int_{x_1}^{x_2} w(x) ~ dx}
  {\displaystyle \int_{a}^{b} w(x) ~ dx}
$$

Let's consider an example taken from the real world. Suppose we're on a manhunt
for a wanted criminal. We've narrowed down their possible location to the
following:

<Plot2 
  geo={[
    {type:"circle", xy:[0,0], r:4, class:`redCircle`},
    {type:"circle", xy:[0,0], r:6, class: `blueCircle`},
    {type:"ray", start:[0,0], end:[3.5,0]},
    {type:"ray", start:[0,0], end:[0,5.5]},
    {type:`label`, xy:[0.5,3], id:`r_2`,fontSize:1.1},
    {type:`label`, xy:[2,-0.05], id:`r_1`,fontSize:1.1},
  ]}
  noAxes={true}
  scale={70}
/>

The question: What are the odds that the crook is somewhere in the blue region?
To simplify our computation, we make the following assumption:

<dfn>

The number of hits is proportional to ${ce^{-r^2},}$ where ${c}$ is a constant,
${e}$ is Euler's number, and ${r}$ is the radius.

</dfn>

This assumption effectively states that the number of hits is a normal
distribution in terms of a given a radius. To understand what this assumption
implies, let's take a look at the plot of the function ${f = e^{-r^2}.}$

<Plot data={[
  {f:(x) => Math.E**(-1 * (x**2))}
]}
domain={[-4,4]}
range={[-0.5,1.2]}
scale={70}
axesLabels={[`radius`,`hits`]}
margins={[50,50,50,50]}
ticks={0}
id={`ia0`}
/>

Suppose that, instead of a manhunt, we were throwing darts. When we make the
assumption above, we're stating that, if we threw millions of darts, more of
them would land closer to the middle (the _top of the bell curve_), and fewer of
them would land towards the lower and upper ends.

Question: Why specifically do we use the function ${f = e^{-r^2}?}$ Why not some
other function? This is probability question rather than a calculus question, so
we won't answer it in detail (it's akin to asking why we would use one kinematic
equation over another given a physics problem). It's simply the most accurate
model for our purposes. When the Germans bombed London during the Second World
War, the British miliary found that among all the possible functions they could
use to predict where the bombs might land, the function ${f = e^{-r^2}}$ proved
to be the most accurate.
