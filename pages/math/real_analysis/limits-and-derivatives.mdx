# Limits and Derivatives

### Rolle's Theorem

> __~rolle's theorem~.__ Let ${f:D \subseteq \reals \to \reals}$ be [continuous](#continuity) on the closed interval ${\cic{a}{b}}$ and [differentiable on the open interval](#differentiable-on-an-interval) ${\oio{a}{b}.}$ If ${f(a)=b(a)=0,}$ then there exists a value ${c \in \oio{a}{b}}$ such that ${f'(c)=0.}$

### l'Hopital's Rule
The requirements of differentiability ultimately lead to _l'Hopital's Rule_. In short, the rule allows us to work with limits that can't be handled with the limit laws alone. Namely, limits of indeterminate forms like ${\frac{0}{0}}$ or ${\frac{\infty}{\infty}.}$

l'Hopital's rule is best presented in three forms: the _Weak l'Hopital's Rule_, the _Strong l'Hopital's Rule_, and the _Extended l'Hopital's Rule_. Really, there's just one statement of the rule — a general case — but stating different versions of the rule distinctily makes the rule's applications explicit.

#### Requirements of l'Hopital
All the various forms of l'Hopital's Rule have four _necessary conditions_, listed below. If just one of these conditions is false, we cannot apply l'Hopital's Rule.

1. The limits must result in an indeterminate form. That is, ${\ll{x}{a}f(x) = \ll{x}{a}g(x) = 0}$ or ${\ll{x}{a}f(x) = \ll{x}{a}g(x) = \pm \infty.}$
2. The functions ${f}$ and ${g}$ must be differentiable on the interval containing ${x=a}$ (except possible at ${a}$).
3. For all ${x \neq a}$ in the interval containing ${a,}$ we must have ${g'(x) \neq 0.}$
4. The limit of the quotient of derivatives, ${\ll{x}{a}\dfrac{f'(x)}{g'(x)},}$ must exist.
