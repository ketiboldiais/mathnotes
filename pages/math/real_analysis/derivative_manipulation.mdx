# Derivative Manipulation


## The Sum Rule

The above derivation yields the following:

Sum Rule for Derivatives. Let ${f(x)}$ and ${g(x)}$ be differentiable
functions. Then the derivative of the sum of ${f}$ and ${g}$ is the sum
of the derivative of ${f}$ and the derivative of ${g:}$

$$
	\dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x) + g(x)) = \dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x)) + \dfrac{d}{dx}(g(x))
$$



## The Difference Rule




## Constant Multiple Rule

What is the derivative of ${f(x) = x^3 - x^2\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)?}$
This may seem complex, but we know enough to handle this. To begin with,
the term ${\dfrac{\pi}{2}}$ is just a constant. Thus, we can really write
this function as: ${f(x) = C(g(x)),}$ where ${g(x) = x^3 - x^2}$ and
${C = \dfrac{\pi}{2}.}$ Let's come up with a rule for computing the
derivative of ${f(x) = C(g(x)).}$

Because we can factor out constants from limits, applying the derivative
definition is straightforward. First, the derivative of ${f'(x)}$ is the
derivative ${(C(g(x)))'.}$ Thus:

$$
	\begin{aligned} f'(x) = (C(g(x)))' &= \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{Cg(x + h) - Cg(x)}{h} \\[1em] &= C \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h} \\[1em] &= Cg'(x) \end{aligned}
$$

From our derivation above, we have the following rule:

> differentiable and ${C}$ is a constant:
>
> $$
> 	\dfrac{d}{dx}Cf(x) = C \cdot \dfrac{d}{dx}f(x)
> $$

Thus, the derivative of ${f(x) = x^3 - x^2\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)}$ is
a simple application of the constant multiple rule, difference rule, and
power rule:

$$
	f'(x) = (3x^2 - 2x)\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)
$$

## The Product Rule



We now have a general derivative formula, the product rule:

> _Product Rule_. Given functions ${f}$ and ${g,}$ the derivative of
> ${fg,}$ denoted ${(fg)',}$ is the sum of the derivative of the function
> ${f,}$ denoted ${f',}$ times ${g,}$ and the derivative of the function
> ${g,}$ denoted ${g',}$ times ${f.}$ I.e.,
>
> $$
> 	(fg)' = f'g + fg'
> $$

For example, suppose we are given the functions ${f(x) = x^n}$ and
${g(x) = \sin x.}$ The product of these functions:

$$
	(f \cdot g)(x) = x^n \sin x
$$

What is the derivative of ${(f \cdot g)?}$ We apply the product rule:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		(f \cdot g)' &= f'g + fg'
		&= (x^n)' \sin x + (x^n) (\sin x)
		&= (nx^{n-1})(\sin x) + (x^n)(\cos x)
	\end{aligned}
$$

## Quotient Rule



From the derivation above, we have the following rule:

> _Quotient Rule_. Given functions ${f}$ and ${g,}$ the derivative of
> ${\dfrac{f}{g},}$ denoted ${\left(\dfrac{f}{g}\right)',}$ is provided by
> the following:
>
> $$
> 	\left(\dfrac{f}{g}\right)' = \dfrac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}
> $$

Accordingly, the derivative of ${t(x) = \dfrac{5x + 1}{3x - 4}}$ is:

$$
	\begin{aligned} t'(x) &= \dfrac{\frac{d}{dx}(5x + 1) \cdot (3x - 4) - (5x + 1) \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(3x - 4)}{(3x - 4)^2} \\[1em] &= \dfrac{(5)(3x - 4) - (5x + 1)(3)}{(3x - 4)^2} \\[1em] &= \dfrac{15x - 20 - 15x - 3}{(3x - 4)^2} \\[1em] &= - \dfrac{23}{(3x - 4)^2} \end{aligned}
$$
