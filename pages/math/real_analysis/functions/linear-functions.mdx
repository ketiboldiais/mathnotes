# Linear Functions

> __~definition~.__ Given ${a \in \reals}$ and a constant ${b}$ in ${\reals,}$ we call a function of the form ${f(x) = ax + b}$ a _linear function_.

> __~definition~.__ Given a constant ${c \in \reals,}$ we call a function of the form ${f(x)=c}$ a _constant function_.

> __~definition~.__ The function ${f(x)=x}$ is called the _identity function_.

## Derivatives of Linear Functions
Given a function ${f(x)=ax + b,}$ the derivative of ${f}$ is simply ${a.}$ That is, ${f'(x)=a.}$ Because linear functions are the simplest functions to understand, we examine our first set of derivative rules.
