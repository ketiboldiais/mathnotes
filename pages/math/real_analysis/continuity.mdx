# Continuity

## Definitions

> 
> (1) ${f}$ has a left-hand limit ${L,}$

## Bounded Functions
> __~definition~.__ Let ${\cic{a}{b}}$ be a closed interval in ${\reals,}$ and let ${y = f(x)}$ be a function in ${\reals.}$ If ${f}$ is continuous on ${\cic{a}{b},}$ then we say that ${f}$ is _bounded_ on ${\cic{a}{b}.}$

## Differentiability
> __~definition~.__ let ${y=f(x)}$ be a function in ${\reals,}$ with ${\dom{f}}$ containing an open interval about ${x = a.}$ We say that ${f}$ is _differentiable_ at ${x = a}$ if, and only if, the limit:
> 
> $$
> 	\ll{h}{0} \dfrac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}
> $$
> 
> exists. If ${f}$ is differentiable at ${a}$ for all ${a \in \dom{f},}$ then we say that ${f}$ is a _differentiable function_.

## Limits and Continuity
In this section, we tie limits to continuity. So far, we've been using
these ideas somewhat sloppily. To make best use of these concepts, we must
subject them to more rigorous treatment. As a first step, let's revisit the informal definition. Suppose we have a function, ${f(x).}$ If we can get ${f(x)}$ as close as possible to some real number ${A}$ by making ${x}$ as close as possible, but not equal, to some real number ${a,}$ then we say that ${f(x)}$ has a limit of ${A}$ as ${x}$ approaches ${a.}$ We denote this proposition with the notation:

$$
	\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = A.
$$

In turn, when we write ${\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = A,}$ we say that
${f(x)}$ converges to ${A}$ as ${x}$ approaches ${a.}$ Some limits are
relatively easy to compute. We just have to substitute:

$$
	\lim\limits_{x \to 2} \dfrac{x^2 + 3}{x + 1} = \dfrac{(2)^2 + 3}{(2) + 1} = \dfrac{4 + 3}{3} = \dfrac{7}{3}.
$$

Usually, derivatives are harder to compute than simple limits. This is
because we are computing the limit of a quotient that takes functions as
inputs:

$$
	\lim\limits_{x \to _0} \dfrac{f(c + \Delta x) - f(c) }{x - c}.
$$

This is a good example of how framing, or rewriting, propositions and
expressions can dramatically change a problem. Here's an interesting point:
If we suppose ${x = c,}$ then we always get ${\frac{0}{0}.}$ And as we
know, ${\frac{0}{0}}$ is something we do not want in continuous
mathematics. In other words, the assumption ${x = c}$ doesn't work in the
context of the difference quotient. Because of this issue, we must always
have some form of cancellation, or simplification, of the difference
quotient. To better understand limits, we need a few more pieces of notation. The expression:

$$
	\lim\limits_{x \to c^+} f(x)
$$

is called the _right-hand limit_. The right-hand limit expresses two
propositions:

1. ${x}$ is approaching ${c,}$ and
2. ${x > c}$

In other words, "${x}$ is approaching ${c}$ from the right" (hence, the
"right-hand limit"). Since ${x > c,}$ the two propositions allow us to
infer that ${x}$ is getting smaller and smaller. In contrast, the
expression:

$$
	\lim\limits_{x \to c^-} f(x)
$$

is called the _left-hand limit_. The left-hand limit expresses two
propositions:

1. ${x}$ is approaching ${c}$ and
2. ${x < c}$

Thus, the notation encapsulates the statement, "${x}$ is approaching
${c}$ from the left." Since ${x < 0,}$ this statement implies that ${x}$
is getting bigger and bigger.

The left- and right-hand limits are the component propositions of
${\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x).}$ More formally:

> __~definition~__. $$ \lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x) = L \nc \begin{cases}
> &\lim\limits_{x \to c^-} f(x) = L \\ \\ &\land \\ \\ &\lim\limits_{x
> \to c^+} f(x) = L \end{cases} $$

Notice the direction of the implication. It only goes one way. The fact that there are left- and right-hand limits does not imply that there is a general limit. However, the fact that there is a general limit implies that there are left- and right-hand limits. As we will see with infinite discontinuities, a function can have left- and right-hand limits without having a general limit. Having these two notations allows us to decompose difficult limits. Instead of trying to tackle the limit by thinking of it all at once, we divide it into two parts, (1) the limit from the left, and (2) the limit from the right. Limits for piecewise functions are the most likely contenders for difficult computation:

$$
	f(x) = \begin{cases} x + 1 &x > 0 \\[1em] -x + 2 &x < 0 \end{cases}
$$

Graphically, this function looks like:

What is the limit of ${f(x)?}$ The notation we just covered is helpful:

$$
	\lim\limits_{x \to 0^+} f(x) = \lim\limits_{x \to 0} (x + 1) = 1 \\
	\lim\limits_{x \to 0^-} f(x) = \lim\limits_{x \to 0} (-x + 2) = 2
$$

Notice that we did not use ${x = 0}$ as a value.

## Continuity
Having elaborated further on limits, we now address the concept of continuity. To begin, recall that functions come in various shapes and sizes. For example, some functions continue forever. Functions like ${y = e^x,}$ ${y = \sqrt{x},}$ ${y = \ln x,}$ and the trigonometric functions like ${\sin x}$ continue indefinitely. In contrast, there are functions that have a "hole" along their graph, like ${f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}.}$ Finally, there are functions with two or more branches which are not connected. E.g., ${f(x) = \frac{1}{x}.}$ We now formalize this phenomenon.

> __~definition~__. If and only if ${f}$ is continuous at ${c,}$ then the
> limit of ${f(x)}$ as ${x}$ approaches 0 is equal to ${f(c).}$

In other words: ${f(x)}$ is continuous at ${c}$ if, and only if,k ${\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c).}$ Functions that continue indefinitely, without any holes, are said to be continuous. More specifically, we say that such functions are "continuous on its whole domain." If a function ${f}$ is not continous — i.e., does not continue indefinitely given its domain — then are three possibilities: (1) ${f}$ is not continuous at some value (a hole in the function's graph); (2) ${f}$ is discontinuous at some value (a "jump" in ${f}$'s graph'); or (3) ${f}$ has a discontinuity at some value (a "break" in the ${f}$'s graph, such as a vertical asymptote'). Our definition for continuity contains several propositions. When we say, "${f}$ is continuous at ${c}$" we imply: ${\lim_{x \to c} f(x)}$ exists. The proposition above then implies: ${\lim_{x \to c^+} f(x)}$ exists, and that ${\lim_{x \to c^-} f(x)}$ exists. I.e., that there are left- and right-hand limits for ${f(x).}$ Moreover, continuity implies that these the left- and right-hand limits are the same. Furthermore, continuity implies that ${f(c)}$ is defined. There can never be continuity if ${f(c)}$ is undefined. This is why understanding a function's domain is critical. To summarize, to prove a function ${f}$ is continuous at ${x = a}$ we must prove that the following propositions are true:

> 1. ${f(a)}$ is defined
> 2. ${\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x)}$ exists
> 3. ${f(a) = \lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x)}$

We should be very clear about defining continuity. When we say that ${f(c)}$ is continuous, we are implying that ${\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)}$ The left and right-hand side of the equation above are completely independent. At no point is ${x = c.}$ In fact, ${x \neq c.}$ The limit is intended to express what happens when ${f}$ is close to ${c.}$ Earlier, we said that some limits are easy, in that we can just substitute values. The limit above is the opposite. These are the kinds of limits that are more difficult, in that we cannot simply just substitute values. The expression ${f(c)}$ is the result of an "easy limit" — the kind of limit where we can simply substitute. The other expression, ${\lim_{x \to c} f(x)}$ are the more difficult limits. The ones where we cannot just use substitution. Instead, ${\lim_{x \to c} f(x)}$ is the kind of limit where we must decompose the limit into its left- and right-hand sides or find some form of cancellation, then determine whether they are equivalent to ${f(c.)}$

## Discontinuity
As stated earlier, not all functions are continuous; some functions are discontinuous, or discontinuous at certain points. Accordingly, we should address these functions briefly. To recap, there if a function is not continuous, there are possibilities: (1) The function ${f}$ is not continuous at some value (e.g., a hole); (2) the function ${f}$ is discontinuous at some some value (e.g., a jump); or (3) the function has a discontinuity at some value (e.g., a vertical asymptote). More formally: For some functions, we can remove these discontinuities. For others, we cannot. Formally:

> __~definition~__. Suppose ${f}$ is a function discontinuous at ${x = a.}$ If
> ${\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x)}$ exists, then ${f}$ has a removable
> discontinuity at ${x = a.}$ Else, ${f}$ has an essential discontinuity at
> ${x = a.}$

Discontinuity comes in various forms. The first such form we explore are
the jump discontinuities. A jump discontinuity occurs when both left- and
right-hand limits exist, but are not equal.

> __~definition: jump discontinuity~__. A jump discontinuity exists if and only
> if:
>
> 1. ${\exists \lim\limits_{x \to c^-} f(x),}$
> 2. ${\exists \lim\limits_{x \to c^+} f(x),}$ and
> 3. ${\lim\limits_{x \to c^-} f(x) \neq \lim\limits_{x \to c^+} f(x)}$

The piecewise function we saw earlier is an example of a function with a jump discontinuity. One limit was 1, the other limit was 2. Another form of discontinuity is the removable discontinuity. In a function with a removable discontinuity, the left- and right-hand limits are equal, but there is some hole, or gap, in the function's graph. For example:

<Fig

Consider, for example, the following functions:

$$
	g(x) = \dfrac{\sin x}{x}, \\[1em]
	h(x) = \dfrac{1 - \cos x}{x}.
$$

Notice that ${g(0)}$ is undefined. It turns out, however, that ${g(x)}$ has a removable discontinuity ${\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1}$ Similarly, ${h(0)}$ is also undefined, and ${h}$ also has a removable discontinuity: ${\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos x}{x} = 0}$ Based on these facts, we say that ${g(x) = \frac{\sin x}{x}}$ and ${h(x) = \frac{1 - \cos x}{x}}$ have removable discontinuities at ${x = 0.}$ The two facts above will be used extensively in later sections when we handle the derivatives of trigonometric functions. The third form of a discontinuity is the infinite discontinuity. Consider the function ${f(x) = 1/x.}$ Its graph appears as:

Viewing this graph, ${\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infty.}$ In contrast, ${\lim_{x \to 0^-} \frac{1}{x} = - \infty.}$ The graph of ${\frac{1}{x}}$ demonstrates that there are, in fact, definite limits of ${\frac{1}{x}.}$ However, there is no such thing as ${\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{x}.}$ Notice this distinction. There are left- and right-hand limits, but there is no general limit. Let's briefly consider the derivative of ${y = \frac{1}{x}.}$ We know that ${y = \frac{1}{x} = x^{-1},}$ so ${y' = (-1)(x)^{-2}.}$ In other words, ${y' = -\frac{1}{x^2}.}$ The graph:

Note how the graph looks entirely different from ${\frac{1}{x}}$. Newcomers to the kingdom of calculus often think that derivatives ought to look similar to their undifferentiated forms. This intuition is very tempting, and it is very wrong. More often than note, derivatives look nothing like their undifferentiated forms, and we must rid ourselves of such notions. The graph of a derivative is a graphical representation of how the function's slope changes. In the graph of ${\frac{1}{x},}$ the right branch's slope gets less steep as we get closer and closer to ${x = 0.}$ This is why the right branch of ${-\frac{1}{x^2}}$ gets closer and closer to ${x = 0.}$ Similarly, as the right branch gets closer to ${y = 0,}$ the corresponding right branch in ${- \frac{1}{x^2}}$ gets closer and closer to ${y = 0.}$ The slope of ${\frac{1}{x},}$ however, is always negative, hence the position of the right branch of ${- \frac{1}{x^2}.}$ The same analysis goes for the left branch of ${\frac{1}{x}.}$

The graph of ${y' = - \frac{1}{x^2}}$ confirms our understanding of the left- and right-hand limits. ${\lim_{x \to 0} y' = - \infty.}$ This general limit implies that ${\lim_{x \to 0^+} y' = - \infty,}$ and ${\lim_{x \to 0^-} y' = - \infty.}$ ${\frac{1}{x}}$ and its derivative ${- \frac{1}{x^2}}$ is a good example of another phenomenon. The function ${y = \frac{1}{x}}$ is an odd function, and the function ${y' = - \frac{1}{x^2}}$ is an even function. This is not a coincidence. The derivative of an odd function will always return an even function. There is one final form of discontinuities we might encounter. We colloquially call these ugly discontinuities. There are many variants of ugly discontinuities, but one that we are likely to encounter most is ${\lim_{x \to 0} y = \sin \frac{1}{x}.}$ There are no left- or right- hand limits for this function. This appears to violate our rule regarding general limits, but there is a work-around for these functions. However, we will not worry about these limits for now. We mention them here in the event they appear.

## Differentiability Implies Continuity
> __~theorem~__. If ${f}$ is differentiable (i.e., there exists a derivative for ${f}$) at ${c,}$ then ${f}$ is continuous at ${c.}$

> ~proof~. The proposition to be proved: ${\lim_{x \to c} f(x) - f(c) = 0.}$ We can rewrite the proposition as ${\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} (x-c).}$ Taking the limit, we have ${\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} (x-c) = f'(c) \cdot 0 = 0.}$ Thus, ${\lim_{x \to c} f(x) - f(c) = 0.}$ ${\blacksquare}$
