## Sequences

A real sequence is a function that maps natural numbers to real numbers. If
${0 \in \NN,}$ we write:

$$
   a: \NN \to \RR
$$

If ${0 \notin \NN,}$ we write:

$$
   a : \NN_0 \to \RR
$$

We may also denote a real sequence by writing any of the following:

$$
   (a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n) \\[1em]
   (a_n)_{n \in \NN} \\[1em]
   (a_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} \\[1em]
   (a_n)
$$

We can define sequences by writing a rule of assignment:

$$
 (a_n)_{n \in \NN} = ((-1)^n)_{n \in \NN} = (-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, \ldots)
$$

We can also plot this sequence:

<Sequence data={[{ f: (n) => (-1) ** n }]} scale={40} />

Here's another sequence, perhaps more interesting:

$$
 (a_n)_{n \in \NN} = \paren{\dfrac{1}{n}}_{n \in \NN} = \paren{1, \dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{1}{3}, \dfrac{1}{4}, \dfrac{1}{5}, \ldots}
$$

Here we have a sequence that gets smaller and smaller. In fact, this
sequence get's very, very close to zero. We'll later denote this as:

$$
   \ll{n}{\infty} a_n = 0
$$

Of course, not all sequences have this special property:

$$
   (a_n)_{n \in \NN} = \paren{2^n}_{n \in \NN} = \paren{2,4,8,16,32,64,\ldots}
$$

Clearly, this sequence just gets bigger and bigger. It's not a _convergent
sequence_.

> convergent to an ${a \in \RR}$ if the members of ${a_n}$ lie arbitrarily
> close to ${a}$ eventually.

A good way to get some idea of what this definition means is to think about
a number line:

<Plot
 geo={[
  { type: "line", start: [-5, 0], end: [5, 0] },

     { type: "point", xy: [0, 0] },
     { type: "point", xy: [-4, 0] },
     { type: "point", xy: [4, 0] },
     { type: "label", xy: [-0.15, -0.5], id: "a" },
     { type: "label", xy: [-4.75, -0.5], id: "a - \\varepsilon" },
     { type: "label", xy: [3.4, -0.5], id: "a + \\varepsilon" },
    ]}
    noAxes={true}
    height={90}

/>

Everything from (not including) ${a - \varepsilon}$ to (not including)
${a + \varepsilon}$ is called the __epsilon neighborhood__ of ${a,}$ where
${\varepsilon > 0.}$ When we say that a sequence converges, we're really
saying that all of the sequence's terms must eventually gather in ${a}$'s
epsilon neighborhood:

With this intuition, we can now give a more formal definition.


<dfn id={`definition-of-convergence`}>

__convergence.__ A sequence ${a_n}$ is _convergent_ to ${a \in \RR}$ iff for
${\varepsilon \gtn 0,}$ there exists an ${N \in \NN}$ such that, for all ${n
\gte N,}$

$$
	| a_n - a | \ltn \varepsilon
$$

</dfn>


<dfn id={`definition-of-divergence`}>

__divergence.__ A sequence ${a_n}$ is said to be _divergent_ iff it
is not convergent.

</dfn>

Some nuances: With convergence, the sequence's terms never "become ${a.}$" They
merely get closer and closer to ${a.}$ Newcomers to real analysis often forget
this point, and part of it may be because of not knowing what the word
"converge" actually means. When hearing the word "converge," many of us
immediately think "join together" or "meet." We must cleanse ourselves of such
thoughts. The word converge means "approaches" or "attracts." In the world of
real analysis, it never — never — means "meet" or "become." Think of it like
bugs to a lightbulb: Some bugs have positive photoaxis (e.g., moths), and
_converge_ towards the light. Others have negative photoaxis (e.g., cockroaches)
and _diverge_ from the light.

Based on the definition above, we can provide a proof that the sequence ${a_n =
1/n}$ converges to 0. Because this is our first encounter with a proof in real
analysis, we'll build it slowly.

To prove that ${a_n = 1/n}$ converges, we first examine our definition of
convergence. The definition requires ${\varepsilon}$ to be greater than 0. We'll
state this as an assumption, our first sentence:

<dfn>

__proof__. Let ${\varepsilon \gtn 0.}$

</dfn>

The definition also gives us the last sentnece of our proof: That ${\abs{a_n -
a} \ltn \varepsilon.}$ We also know that ${a = 0,}$ since that's the number
we're claiming that ${1/n}$ converges to.

<dfn>

__proof__. Let ${\varepsilon \gtn 0.}$ For ${n \gte N,}$ we have ${\abs{a_n - 0 \ltn \varepsilon}.}$

</dfn>

We also have ${a_n = 1/n,}$ so let's fill that in:

<dfn>

__proof__. Let ${\varepsilon \gtn 0.}$ For ${n \gte N,}$ we have ${\abs{1/n - 0 \ltn \varepsilon}.}$

</dfn>

Since ${n \in \N}$ and we're just subtracting zero, we don't actually need that
zero in there, and we can get rid of the absolute value bars:

<dfn>

__proof__. Let ${\varepsilon \gtn 0.}$ For ${n \gte N,}$ we have ${1/n \ltn \varepsilon.}$

</dfn>

The next step is recognizing that since ${n \gte N,}$ we have:

$$
 1/n \lte 1/N \ltn \varepsilon
$$

Revising our proof:

<dfn>

__proof__. Let ${\varepsilon \gtn 0.}$ For ${n \gte N,}$ we have ${1/n \lte
1/N \ltn \varepsilon.}$

</dfn>

The only left is to prove that ${1/N \ltn \varepsilon.}$ Let's make this a
little easier to think about by rewriting the inequality:

$$
 1 \ltn N \cdot \varepsilon
$$

Nothing fancy here, we just multiplied ${N}$ to both sides. This is where we
pull an axiom: _The Archimedean Property of Real Numbers._

<dfn>

__archimedean property of real numbers.__ Given any ${x \in \RR^+}$ and ${y \in
\RR,}$ there exists an ${n \in \Z^+}$ such that:

$$
 y \ltn nx
$$

</dfn>

The Archimedean property of real numbers tells us that no matter how small an
positive real number is, we can always make it bigger than any other real number
we choose by adding the number ${n}$ times. Because of this property, our
proof's final piece is merely requiring that the reader choose some number:

<dfn>

__proof__. Let ${\varepsilon \gtn 0.}$ Choose an ${N \in \NN}$ such
that ${N \cdot \varepsilon \gtn 1.}$ It follows that: For ${n \gte N,}$ we have

$$
 \begin{aligned}
  \abs{a_n - 0} &= \abs{a_n} \\[1em]
  &= \dfrac{1}{n} \lte \dfrac{1}{N} \ltn \varepsilon
 \end{aligned}
$$

</dfn>

Let's consider another example. How might we prove that the sequence:

$$
 a_n = (-1)^n
$$

is divergent? In this case, we know that a sequence that is _not_ convergent is
divergent. Because of this negation, an intuitive approach is proof by
contradiction — we want to _disprove_ that ${a_n = (-1)^n}$ is convergent.

We know that for a sequence to converge, it must be true that the sequence's
terms eventually gather at the neighborhood of some real number ${a.}$ As we
saw, that's not the case for the sequence ${a_n = (-1)^n.}$ The terms always
bounce between ${-1}$ and ${1.}$ This means that it doesn't matter what ${a}$ we
choose. There will always be infinitely many points far from ${a.}$

Recall our convergence definition's requirements:

1. ${\forall \varepsilon \gtn 0}$
2. ${\exists N \in \NN}$
3. ${\forall n \gte \N : \abs{a_n - a \ltn \varepsilon}}$

Given these requirements, we want to choose an ${\varepsilon}$ that's small
enough to ensure that the epsilon neighborhood of ${a}$ excludes ${1}$ and
${-1.}$.  Symbolically, we want an ${\varepsilon}$ smaller or equal to 1:

$$
	\varepsilon = 1
$$

Choosing ${\varepsilon=1,}$ our ${a}$ lies somewhere:

$$
	(a - \varepsilon) \ltn a \ltn (a + \varepsilon) = (a - 1) \ltn a \ltn (a + 1)
$$

which effectively excludes ${-1}$ and ${1.}$ This implies that:

1. ${\abs{a_N - a} \ltn \varepsilon}$ and
2. ${\abs{a_{N+1} - a \ltn \varepsilon}}$

Because ${\N \in \NN,}$ we know that one of the indices is even, and the other
is odd. This ensures that we always get the outcomes ${-1}$ and ${1:}$

$$
	\abs{1-a} \ltn \varepsilon  \\
	\tt{ and } \\
	\abs{(-1)-a} \ltn \varepsilon
$$

At this point, we've unearthed the contradiction, since ${\varepsilon = 1:}$

$$
	\abs{1-a} \ltn 1 \\
	\tt{ and } \\
	\abs{(-1)-a} \ltn 1
$$

This is a blatant violation of the _triangle inequality._ If we add both of
these distances:

$$
	\abs{1-a} + \abs{(-1) - a} \ltn 2
$$

Next, we have the following equality:

$$
	2 = \abs{1 - (-1)} = \abs{ 1 - a + a - (-a) }
$$

Applying the triangle inequality:

$$
	2 = \abs{1 - (-1)} = \abs{ 1 - a + a - (-a) } \lte \abs{1 - a} + \abs{a -
	(-1)}
$$

That right-hand side is exactly:

$$
		2 = \abs{1 - (-1)} = \abs{ 1 - a + a - (-a) } \lte \abs{1-a} + \abs{(-1) - a} \ltn 2
$$

${2 \ltn 2?}$ Yes, but only if it turns out that ${a_n = (-1)^n}$ converges. So,
it cannot be true that ${a_n = (-1)^n}$ converges. Therefore, ${a_n = (-1)^n}$
is divergent.

## Bounded Sequences

We saw that ${a_n = (-1)^n}$ is a divergent sequence. It's also a good example
of a _bounded sequence_.

<dfn>

__definition.__ A sequence ${a_n}$ is a _bounded sequence_ if
there exists a real number ${c}$ such that for all the terms of ${a_n,}$ the
distance of ${a_n}$ to zero is less than or equal to ${c.}$ Otherwise, thei
sequence is an _unbounded sequence._

</dfn>

Let's break this definition down to a procedure:


<Algo>

1. Input:
	1. ${a_n}$ - A sequence
	2. ${c \in \RR}$
2. For ${i = 0}$ to ${i = n}$
	1. If ${\abs{a_i} \gtn c,}$ return "${a_n}$ is unbounded"
3. Return "${a_n}$ is bounded"

</Algo>

We can visualize this definition as follows:

<Fig
	link={"https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1662414061/math/bounded_sequence_npjwfr.svg"}
	imwidth={"343"}
	imheight={"72"}
	caption={"bounded sequence"}
	width={"60"}
/>

In the case of ${a_n = (-1)^n,}$ its two terms were always ${-1}$ and ${1.}$
Importantly, the fact that a sequence converges implies that it is bounded _but
not the other way around._ 

$$
	\tt{convergence} \implies \tt{boundedness}
$$

This leads to a further inference:

$$
	\small \neg \tt{boundedness} \implies \tt{unboundedness} \implies \neg \tt{convergence} \implies \tt{divergence}
$$

## The Limit of a Sequence

The number ${a \in \RR}$ in the definition of convergence is called the _limit_
of ${a_n.}$ An important point about _the_ limit is that there is one, and only
one, ${a \in \RR}$ that ${a_n}$ converges to.

Why? Well let's say there were two distinct limits: ${a}$ and ${a'.}$ This
implies that ${a \neq a',}$  which in turn implies that ${\abs{a - a'} \gtn 0.}$
This also means that the sequence's members gather in _two_ epsilon
neighborhoods. One around ${a,}$ and the other around ${a'.}$ Clearly, this
contradicts convergence. 

But, let's be more formal to extinguish all doubt. Suppose ${\varepsilon =
1/4.}$ This yields:

$$
	\varepsilon = (1/4) \abs{a - a'} \gtn 0
$$

By the definition of convergence, it follows that:

1. There exists an ${N \in \NN}$ such that ${\forall n \gte N,}$ ${\abs{a_n - a
   \ltn \varepsilon,}}$ and
2. There exists an ${N' \in \NN}$ such that ${\forall n \gte \N',}$ ${\abs{a_n -
  a' \gtn \varepsilon.}}$

Therefore, ${n \gte \max(N,N').}$ By the triangle inequality, we have:

$$
	\abs{a - a'} = \abs{a - a_n + a_n - a'} \lte \abs{a - a_n} + \abs{a_n - a'}
$$

But, we know that ${\abs{a - a_n} \ltn \varepsilon,}$ and ${\abs{a_n - a'} \ltn
\varepsilon.}$ So:

$$
	\abs{a - a'} \ltn (1/2) \abs{a - a'}
$$

This can't be right. Since ${\varepsilon}$ is positive. Hence, it must be the
case that there is one, and only one, limit of a sequence ${a_n.}$ Given this
fact, we can now proceed to writing:

$$
	\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = a
$$

whenever we want to express the limit of some sequence ${a_n.}$ The notion of a
limit notation is simply another way to express convergence. Thus, when we
write:

$$
	\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = a
$$

we are saying:

> The members of the sequence ${a_n}$ converge to ${a \in \R}$ eventually.

## Limit Theorems

Now that we have an idea of what a limit is, let's derive some limit theorems.
Having these theorems will turn out to be very useful in our future discussions.

### Sum of Limits

Say we have two convergent sequences, ${a_n}$ and ${b_n.}$ That is:

$$
	\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = a \\
	\lim_{n \to \infty} b_n = b
$$

It would be pretty interesting if:

$$
	\lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n + b_n) = s
$$

That is, the sum of the convergent sequences ${a_n}$ and ${b_n}$ has a unique
limit ${c.}$ Moreover, it would be even more interesting if:

$$
	\lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n + b_n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n + \lim_{n \to
	\infty} b_n
$$

### Product of Limits

$$
	\lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n \cdot b_n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \cdot \lim_{n
	\to \infty} b_n
$$

### Quotient of Limits

$$
	\lim_{n \to \infty} \dfrac{a_n}{b_n} = \dfrac{\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n}{\lim_{n
	\to \infty} b_n} ~~~(b_n \neq 0)
$$
