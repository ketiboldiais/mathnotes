Statistics is the study, collection, analysis, interpretation, and
presentation of data. For example, consider the following _dot plot_:

<DotPlot
	data={[5, 5.5, 6, 6, 6, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 12]}
	xMin={3}
	xMax={13}
	xLabel={"\\text{hours of sleep}"}
	labelOffsetY={5}
	labelOffsetX={10}
	labelFontSize={0.6}
	marginLeft={10}
	id={"dotPlot1"}
/>

This plot visualizes the results of some survey on the hours of sleep the
respondents are getting. Does this tell us that most people are getting
about 6.5 hours of sleep? Does it tell us that 8 hours, as commonly
recommended, isn't all that common? That anything beyond 12 or less than 6
is "rare?" These are the kinds of questions that statistics answers.

There are two tasks usually done in statistics:

1. Organizing and summarizing data. The methods for accomplishing this task
   are collectively called **descriptive statistics**.
2. Drawing conclusions from data. The methods for accomplishing this task
   are collectively called **inferential statistics**.

With this introduction, let's define some basic terms in statistics.

## Population

In statistics, data is generally collected from some **population**. A
population is a set ‚Äî a collection of entities or objects. The members of
this set might be people, companies, animals, dollars, and so on.

### Samples

Some populations are so large that we can't possibly collect data from
every single member of the population. For example, it's infeasible to
collect data from every single voter in the United States. Because of these
limitations, we instead select a **sample** of the population. A sample is
a subset of the larger population.

### Statistics

From the sample data, we can calculate one or more **statistics** ‚Äî some
number representing a property of the sample. For example, from a survey of
a sample of college students, we might calculate the average grade point
average. Say that average is 3.5. The number 3.5 is a statistic ‚Äî it's a
number that represents a property of the sample; namely, the average GPA.

### Parameters

All statistics are estimates of a **parameter** of the population. A
parameter is a property of the entire population. For example, the average
GPA calculated from the preceding example is an estimate of the average GPA
for _all_ college students.

### Representative Samples

Because all statistics are estimates of some parameter, a principal task in
statistics is answering the question: How accurate is this statistic in
estimating the parameter? Simply put, a statistic's accuracy depends on
whether the sample is a **representative sample**. A sample is considered
representative only if it contains the population's characteristics. For
example, if we wanted to know the average GPA for all biology majors, then
we should be surveying biology majors rather than just any major.

### Variables & Data

As mentioned earlier, populations have characteristics. Some of those
characteristics can be determined ‚Äî e.g., how tall the population member
is, where the population member lives, yes or no to a particular question,
and so on. Each of these determinable characteristics is called a
**variable**.

In statistics, there are two kinds of variables:

1. A **numerical variable** is a variable that can be defined as a value of
   some unit. For example, weight in kilograms, height in meters, or time
   in seconds.
2. A **categorial variable** is a variable that places a person or object
   into a category. For example, the categories of all 50 U.S. states, the
   parties Democrat, Republican, or Independent, or the federal income tax
   brackets.

The values of these variables ‚Äî numerical or categorical ‚Äî are call
**data**.

## Categories of Data

Generally, data falls into two categories:

1. **Qualitative data** is data resulting from categorizing or describing
   population characteristics. For example, from a survey of the
   population, we might gather qualitiative data on the members' ethnic
   groups or the car they drive. Qualitative data is also called
   **categorical data**.
2. **Quantitive data** is data resulting from counting or measuring
   population characteristics. For example, from a survey of the
   population, we might gather quantitative data like the members' weights,
   yearly income, or the number of their dependents.

### Discrete & Continuous Data

Quantitative data consists of two further categories:

1. **Quantitative discrete data (QDD)** is quantiative data that results
   from counting. Because QDD results from counting, QDD ultimately
   consists of integers. For example, the number of junk mail an individual
   receives per day might be 0, 5, or 100, but not 4.8.
2. **Quantiative continuous data (QCD)** is quantitative data that results
   from measurement. As such, this data might take on _real number values_.
   For example, the lengths of phone calls might be 2.4, 1.8, or 6.7
   minutes.

### Random Sampling

Earlier, we mentioned how sampling is a principle concern of statistics. To
obtain a representative sample, we follow a key definition:

> **definition**. Let ${x}$ be some sample of population ${P.}$ ${x}$ is a
> representative sample of ${P}$ if, and only if, ${x}$ has the same
> characteristics as ${P.}$

To satisfy this definition, statisticians employ **random sampling**. In
random sampling, a sample is chosen by ensuring that each member of the
population has an equal chance of being selected. There are many ways to
ensure this condition.

For all the methds presented below, there are a few points to keep in mind:

1. True random sampling requires sampling _with replacement_. That is, if
   we pull out ùê¥ from a list of names, we must put ùê¥ back in the list of
   names to preserve the possibility of selecting ùê¥ more than once.
   Although true random sampling is the ideal, it's often too expensive to
   do in practice.
2. Fortunately, at large sample sizes, there's little to no difference
   between the two. The issue really only comes up small sample sizes.

#### Simple Random Sampling

The easiest method is **simple random sampling**. With this approach, we
select a **sample size** ${n,}$ and from the population ${P,}$ we select
${n}$ members at random. How do we select at random? Well, if the members
consisted of people, we could write their names on slips of paper, put the
slips in a hat, and randomly pull from the hat.

A more sophisticated approach:

1. Select a sample ${S}$ comprising ${n}$ members from population ${P.}$
2. For each member member of ${S,}$ assign a two digit number.
3. Generate random numbers.
4. For each of the random numbers, the matching two digit numbers is a
   selection.

For example, suppose there are 20 voters in some district, and we want a
sample size of 10. For each of the voters, we assign the numbers 01, 02,
03, ..., 20. We then generate random numbers with either a calculator or
some other piece of software. The random number generator might yield
0.9829, 0.325, 0.1582, 0.0683, and so on. For each of these randomly
generated numbers, we read the first matching two digit number as a
selection. For example, from the preceding list, we see 0.1582, so the
voter assigned 15 is selected. We then see 0.06, so the voter assigned 06
is selected.

#### Stratified Sampling

Another random sampling method is **stratified sampling**. The procedure is
as follows:

1. Divide the population into ${n}$ groups.[^strata]
2. From each group, take a _proportionate_ number of members.

[^strata]: These groups are called **strata** (singular **stratum**).

#### Cluster Sampling

Alternatively, we can also employ **cluster sampling** as another random
sampling approach:

1. Divide the population into clusters (groups),
2. randomly select some of the cluster,
3. all the members of the selected clusters form the cluster sample.

#### Systematic Sampling

**Systematic sampling** is useful if we already have a list of all the
population members.

1. Randomly select a starting position ùëñ in the list.
2. From ùëñ, select every ${n^{\tt{th}}}$ member of the list.

### Bad Sampling

Whenever we we're asked, "Is this sample representative?," there are three
questions we should ask ourselves:

1. Were there **sampling errors**? The actual process of collecting the
   sample might have led to errors. Common forms of sampling errors:
   - A sample isn't large enough.
   - A sample is small enough that it should've been done with replacement.
   - The sample is selected from the wrong population.
2. Were there **non-sampling errors**? Errors might be caused not by the
   sampling process itself, but factors outside the process. For example:
   - Surveys are sent, but it's so long that people mindlessly click
     through them.
   - The measurement device is not calibrated/is incorrect.
3. Was there a **sampling bias**? A sampling bias occurs when the sampling
   process causes some members of the population to be more likely to be
   selected than others. We often see this done in political media. A
   right-wing group might run a survey that only gathers responses from
   whites. Call-in surveys, in general, are inherently biased: We're more
   likely to get responses from people willing to answer the phone than
   people who aren't.

## Measurement

Given some dataset ùê∑, the way we measure ùê∑ is called ùê∑'s **level of
measurement**. The dataset's level of measurement determines the data's
_kind_. There are four kinds of data, presented below.

### Categorical Data

> **Definition**. Let ùëÜ be a set of non-numeric values (commonly strings)
> and ${s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots, s_n \subset ùëÜ.}$. Then a datum ùëë is
> considered a _categorical datum_ iff ${ùëë \in s_n.}$

Examples include:

- categories, colors, names
- nationality
- music genres
- ethnicity
- gender
- yes or no responses to questions

Because categorical data is measured purely in qualitative terms, there is
not inherent order ‚Äî it makes no difference if we plot the _yes_ responses
first and the _no_ responses second. Categorical data cannot be used in
calculations directly (it makes no sense to compute _yes_ plus _no_).

As an aside, if the size of the ${S}$ is 2 (${\text{card}(S) = 2 }$), then
the data is called **dichotomous data**. For example, if the set ${S}$
consists of only `"yes"` and `"no"` or `"agree"` and `"disagree"`, each
data point is considered _dichotomous datum_.

With categorical data, the only thing we can do is group the values. E.g.,
one datum goes into the "British" bucket, another goes into the "Afghani"
bucket. However, we cannot sort the values ‚Äî "British" comes before
"French."

### Ordinal Data

> **Definition**. Let ùëÜ be a sorted array of ordinal values (commonly
> strings). A datum ùëë is considered an _ordinal datum_ iff ${ùëë \in ùëÜ.}$

Examples of ordinal data:

- The US News rankings of the top universities,
- the responses "excellent, good, satisfactory, unsatisfactory" to some
  survey

With ordinal data, the only two things we can do are: (1) group the values,
and (2) sort the values. Moreover, the fact that the values are sorted does
not tells us the relative distances between the values. E.g., the fact that
Yale Law School ranks higher than Harvard Law School does not tells us that
it's five, ten, or a thousand times better than Harvard Law School.

### Interval Data

> **Definition**. Let ùêº be an interval of ${\RR}$ _without_ a lower bound
> (called a _meaningful zero_), and where each member of ùêº is equidistant
> from their left and right neighbors. A datum ùëë is considered an _interval
> datum_ iff ${ùëë \in ùêº.}$

Examples:

- Temperature scale data
- Dates
- Time intervals on a 12-hour clock (there's 6am and 6pm)
- pH scale data
- IQ data

Interval data is a sorted array of numeric values, where each value is a
member of some interval, and each interval is equidistant without common
starting point (called a _meaningful zero_). Because there isn't a common
starting point, we can't draw conclusions of the form:

> ùê¥ ùë• than ùêµ

where ùê¥ and ùêµ are data points and ùë• is some predicate like:

- "is smarter",
- "is ùëõ times larger",
- "is ùëõ times hotter"
- "is ùëõ times colder"

For all of those conclusions, we can always pick a starting point that's
further before ùê¥. For example, say we have an interval of times:

$$
   [\ldots, \tt{12pm}, \tt{1pm},\tt{2pm},\tt{3pm},\tt{4pm},\tt{5pm}]
$$

The ellipses indicate that there infinitely many other possible data values
before 1pm. Saying that 4pm is twice as late as 2pm is true only if the
starting point was 12pm. But, because that starting point is not
${\tt{12pm},}$ the statement makes no sense ‚Äî _twice as late with respect
to what?_

With interval data, we can perform these computations:

1.  Grouping: Determining if one datum falls in one interval or another.
2.  Relational: Determining if one datum is greater than another.
3.  Addition: We can add and subtract the data, provided we account for any
    differences between the data's interval.

We cannot multily or divide interval data since there is no meaningful
zero. E.g., it makes no sense to say that "12pm is twice as late as 3pm.""

### Ratio Data

> **Definition**. Let ùêº be an interval of ${\RR}$ _with_ a lower bound
> (called a _meaningful zero_), and where each member of ùêº is equidistant
> from their left and right neighbors. A datum ùëë is considered an _interval
> datum_ iff ${ùëë \in ùêº.}$

Examples of ratio data include:

- Kelvin scale data
- Tax income backet data
- Age data (0 to 100+ years)
- Time intervals on a 24-hour clock

The key difference betwen ratio data and interval data is that we have a
meaningful zero. And because we have a meaningful zero,
