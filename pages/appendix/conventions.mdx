## Natural Numbers
The symbol ${\nat}$ always denotes the _nonnegative integers_: ${\set{0,1,2,3,\ldots}.}$ To denote the positive integers, I use the notation ${\uint^+.}$ I adopt this convention because many of the notes assume von Neumann's construction of the naturals, and I've personally found it's much easier [constructing them](./../math/set_theory/natural-numbers) with ${\nil := 0.}$ This is just anecdote and personal preference. Edmund Landau, in his book ~foundations of analysis~ (1960), uses the classical construction starting at 1, and it's a sterling example of mathematical exposition.

## Choice of Set Theory
A majority of the notes (roughly 98.73% on the last count) assume ZF set theory. As such, the terms "universal set" or "domain of discourse" of the sets ${A,}$ ${B,}$ ${C,}$ etc., are intended to imply that the sets discussed exist in some larger set ${U}$ or ${D.}$ They _do not_ imply that there exists a set of all sets. A minority of the notes delve into other set theory (e.g., NFU). Those notes will always be prefaced with a bold __WITHIN (set theory ${x}$)__. I state this upfront to avoid the "eggshell walking" sensation that occasionally accompanies using set theory terms.

## "Calculus"
As Paul Halmos wrote, "Calculus books are bad because there is no such subject as calculus."[^halmos] Both linguistics and the history of mathematics are on his side. In Latin, the word _calculus_ is the diminutive of _calx_, meaning "limestone" (from which we inherit the word _calcium_). Accordingly, calculus books often translate _calculus_ as "pebble" in a footnote, suggesting the Romans — the people who gaves us arches and the Justinian Code — used rocks to add and subtract. Already, something strange is afoot. Although the Romans certainly weren't as interested in mathematics as the Greeks, they also weren't troglodytes chained to Plato's cave. Those "rocks" were beads on an abacus. 

A better citation would be to the Oxford dictionary's definition: "A particular method or system of calculation or reasoning." This would be in line with what Newton and Leibniz ventured — investigating methods of reasoning about infinites and infinitesimals. It would also hint at why topic transitions in calculus feel rough to many readers. The move from derivatives to integrals is often clear, but not so much volumes, disks, sequences and series. Why? Because the standard calculus course is a smorgasbord of ideas from various mathematical domains: logic, set theory, algebra, geometry, analysis, field theory, topology, differentiation, integration, measure theory, linear algebra, ..., some application the author is interested in.  

Because of this, there aren't any "calculus" notes, in so far as there isn't a heading called _Calculus_. There was such a header at first. But organizing my notes over the years, the header's directory emptied steadily — its contents ebbed, flowing into specific folders without my explicit notice (a side effect of working predominantly via console). A colleague asked one day if I had any materials on calculus, and to my surprise, there was no explicit header called _Calculus_. All of this is to say that branches of mathematics aren't disjoint sets, and the notes may not fall under a heading the reader would expect.

## If
The syntactic structure _if x then y_ communicates: if _x_ is true, then _y_ must be true. On its own, it says nothing about whether _x_ is true or _y_ is true. Thus, it has its own truth value, independent of _x_ and _y_. This point is all too often missed. If it turns out that _x_ is false, then the proposition _if x then y_ is true. The only case where _if x then y_ is false is where _x_ is true and _y_ is false.

## Iff
The idiom _iff_ is a clipping of _if and only if_. It means, if ${x}$ is true,
then ${y}$ is true and if ${y}$ is true ${x}$ is true. Equivalently, if ${x}$ is
is false, then ${x}$ is false, and if ${y}$ is false, ${x}$ is false.

## At Least, At Most
The idiom _at least ${x}$_ implies a floor — there must be, at a minimum, ${x.}$
It also implies that we can have more than ${x.}$ For example, the sentence
"There are at least four apples in the bag" is just a convenient way of
communicating two statements: (1) There can be five, six, seven, ... apples in
the bag, and (2) it is not the case that there are three, two, one, or no apples
in the bag.

The idiom _at most ${x}$_ implies a ceiling — there must be, at most, ${x.}$ It
also implies that we can have less than ${x.}$ The sentence "There are at most
three students in the class" is just a more concise way of saying: (1) There are
either no students in the class, (2) there are one, two, or three students in
the class, and (3) it is not the case that there are four, five, six,...
students in the class. 

## Some
The morpheme _some_ means _at least one_, which implies that there may or may
not be more than one. Thus, when I use the word "some ${x}$" I mean that there
exists at least one ${x,}$ but I don't preclude the possibility of there being
many ${x}$s. The morphemes _many_ and _most_ and the idioms _not all_ and _there
exists_ are all synonyms for _some_.

## But
The syntactic structure _${x}$ but ${y}$_ is prose for _${x}$ and not ${y.}$_
For example, the sentence "Harry ate the cake but didn't like it" is equivalent
to "Harry at the cake and did not like it."

## Only If
The syntactic structure _${x}$ only if ${y}$_ is equivalent to the structure _if
${x}$ then ${y}$_. The idiom "only if" merely introduces the necessary condition
${y.}$

## Any, Every, and Each
The morphemes _any_, _every_, and _each_ are all synonyms for _all_. For
example, the statement "${x-0=x}$ for any real number ${x}$" is equivalent to
saying, "For all real numbers ${x,}$ it is true that ${x-0=x.}$"

## But For
The syntactic structure _${x}$ but for ${y}$_ is equivalent to the statement
_${x}$ was caused by, and only by, ${y}$_.

## Informal Specification Language 
The materials on algorithms are often written in pseudocode, using a language
called ISL (Informal Specification Language). This is a small language I've
constructed to maintain generality and consistency in algorithm specification.
I try to keep the specification as programming language neutral as possible, but
this is much harder than it sounds — some constructs end up resembling C, others
SML, and others Python. There really ought to be a study on programming language
deprivation — Roger Shattuck's "forbidden experiment" _à la vanille_ — where
logicians or set theorists, devoid of any exposure to programming languages, construct a pseudocode language under memory and processing constraints. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), it's unclear whether such a sample space exists.  Some ISL code:
