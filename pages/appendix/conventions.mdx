## Conventions

In examples that use a shell, a single dollar sign indicates a one line command. The default shell is Bash. Commands are broken on to separate lines for readability and tabs indicate a single white space. Different commands are always indicated by dollar signs.

~example~. These are two commands:

~~~
$ docker image prune -a
$ docker build -t mysite-node .
~~~

but this is one command:

~~~
$ docker run
	--name mysite-server
	--rm
	-d
	-p 80:80
	mysite-node
~~~

I use Arch Linux by default and occasionally macOS, so general system-related concepts and workflows should be interpreted with Unix in mind.
